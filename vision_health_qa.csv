Question,Answer
Am I a Candidate for LASIK?,"LASIK is a medical procedure that improves your vision by using a laser. In order to be a candidate for LASIK, you must meet specific criteria involving refractive errors, corneal thickness, and pupil size. You must also meet basic health and age criteria to help you achieve the best possible vision. A LASIK candidate: Should be between years old Must not have certain systemic diseases, like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, collagen vascular disorders, and uncontrolled diabetes Should be in generally good eye health Must not currently be pregnant or nursing No Accutane use within the past three months The best way to find out if you're a candidate for LASIK is to have a thorough examination by a qualified refractive surgeon.During your consultation, our surgeon will: Examine your eyes Tell you about your treatment options Answer any questions you might have To schedule a refractive surgery vision consultation, please call . Soft contact lens patients: If you are wearing soft contact lenses, please remove them from your eyes one week before your screening. Gas permeable or hard contact lens patients: If you are wearing gas permeable contact lenses or PMMA hard lenses, please remove them from your eyes two weeks before your examination."
Am I at risk for cataracts?,"Your risk for cataracts goes up as you get older.

It can be tricky to diagnose color vision deficiency in children. Kids who have color vision deficiency may try to hide it. But having color vision deficiency can make it hard to read from a chalkboard or do other activities, so get your child’s eyes tested if you’re concerned. Get your child’s eyes tested if they have a family history of color vision deficiency or if they seem to be having trouble learning colors. Ask your child’s eye doctor to test them. You also may be able to get your child’s eyes tested at school."
Am I at risk for corneal conditions?,"Some corneal conditions, like corneal dystrophies, run in families. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk of corneal injuries and infections. Toprevent corneal injuries,wear protective eyewear when you: Play sports that use a ball or puck, like baseball or hockey Do yardwork, like mowing the lawn or using a weedwhacker Make repairs, like painting or hammering Use machines, like sanders or drills Use chemicals, like bleach or pesticides If you wear contact lenses, always follow the instructions to clean, disinfect, and store your lenses.

Are There Different Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Not all glaucoma cases are the same. There are actually several types of glaucoma, and your treatment will depend on what type of glaucoma you have. A small percentage of people with glaucoma have a condition known as narrow-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma can occur slowly and progressively or very quickly and can only be detected through an eye exam. Narrow-angle glaucoma usually occurs in far-sighted people because they tend to have anterior chambers that are smaller than normal. In cases of narrow-angle glaucoma, the iris can bow forward, thinning the angle that normally drains the eye. As the angle becomes smaller, fluid backs up and pressure in the eye, or intraocular pressure, begins to rise. If narrow-angle glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause loss of vision. In some cases, narrow-angle glaucoma can lead to an emergency condition known as angle-closure glaucoma. For more information, ask your doctor about narrow angle glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of adult glaucoma and can lead to loss of vision or blindness. This type of glaucoma can only be detected by your eye care practitioner through a routine eye examination. Open-angle glaucoma occurs when the eye’s drainage system becomes clogged over time. A part of this system, called the trabecular meshwork, is a tiny, spongy tissue that allows fluid to leave the eye. This structure is situated in the eye’s angle where the iris and cornea meet. When this drain becomes clogged, aqueous fluid cannot leave the eye as fast as it is produced, causing the fluid to back up. This backed-up fluid increases pressure in the eye and can cause damage to eyesight. If open-angle glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause a gradual loss."

They can refer your child to anoptometristorophthalmologistif your child needs more tests and checks. If your child is referred to an optometrist or ophthalmologist to test for lazy eye, this professional will carefully examine your child’s eyes and vision to diagnose lazy eye and work out what’s causing it. Lazy eye diagnosis involves various tests and tools. For example, the optometrist or ophthalmologist: will check your child’s vision using an eye chart that has letters or symbols on it might use medication like eye drops to measure the focus of your child’s eyes might use equipment like a retinoscope to work out whether glasses might help your child’s lazy eye. Early diagnosis and treatment of lazy eye is essential. The earlier lazy eye is treated, the better the outcomes are for children. If lazy eye is left untreated, it can cause permanent vision loss. Lazy eye in children can usually be corrected with the right treatment. Treatments for lazy eyeaim to strengthen the lazy eye and get it working properly. The specific cause of lazy eye in each individual child guides their treatment. Patchingis a common treatment. Patching is when your child wears a sticky patch over their stronger eye for a period of time each day – usually 1-4 hours. The patch might go directly onto your child’s skin. If your child wears glasses, the patch goes over one lens. To start with, your child might need patching for several hours a day, seven days a week. As your child’s vision improves, they’ll need fewer hours and/or fewer days of patching each week. If your child’s lazy eye is severe, patching."
Eye Numbing Drops: Why Are They Used and Are They Safe?,"Types Uses Side effects Application and precautions Over-the-counter Summary Medical professionals use eye numbing drops to block the nerves in your eye from feeling pain or discomfort. If you’re pregnant or nursing, tell your doctor before getting eye numbing drops. Eye numbing drops are considered atopical anesthetic. They’re used duringeye examsand for surgical procedures involving your eyes. It’s important to understand the distinction between eye numbing drops (used for surgical procedures and eye exams) and other types ofeye drops. Saline drops, artificial tears, and anti-allergy or anti-histamine drops are available over-the-counter to soothe and hydrate your eyes. Antibiotic eye drops are available by prescription to treat eye injuries, likecorneal abrasions. Numbing eye drops don’t have soothing, hydrating, anti-allergy, or antibiotic properties. They’re an anesthetic medication for your eye. When administered in small doses, these drops are considered safe. However, there are some risks of side effects if they’re overused. There are two main types of eye drops used in eye exams and surgical procedures. Both are available only by prescription. Tetracaine drops (AltaCaine, Tetcaine) block the nerve endings in your eye from signaling pain to your brain. Tetracainehas been foundto cause cell death in the cells of your cornea if it’s overused. Proparacaine drops (Alcaine, Ocu-Caine) block the nerve endings in your eye from feeling pain. These drops are considered a topical anesthetic. Some people who are sensitive to other local anesthetics find they’re able to use proparacaine without issue. But in rare cases, proparacaine can cause a serious allergic reaction. Eye numbing drops are used by doctors for several reasons. A corneal abrasion is a scratch in the clear tissue that covers your eye. Most corneal abrasions heal in a day or two. Sometimes, the scratch can become infected and may require antibiotics to heal. Your doctor will typically."

How Are Dry Eyes Treated?,"There are a number of options. Ask your eye doctor what to do. Treatments include: Artificial tear drops and ointments.This is the most common treatment. Many types of drops are available over the counter. No one product works for everyone, so you might have to try a few to figure out the one that’s right for you. If you havechronic dry eye, you need to use the drops even when your eyes feel fine, or they won’t stay wet enough. If your eyes dry out while you sleep, you can use a thick product, like an ointment, at night. You might think about sleeping with airtight goggles on. They'll create a mini ""moisture chamber"" for your eyes. Temporary punctal occlusion.Your doctor might opt to close the punctum, or duct that drains tears from your eye. They might start with a temporary plug designed to dissolve over time. Based on how it works, your doctor will know whether permanent plugs will help. Nondissolvingpunctal plugsand punctal occlusion by cautery (application of heat to tear exit duct).If temporary plugs work well, your doctor may move to longer-lasting ones or may go right to a long-lasting plug. Or they could choose a procedure called cautery. You might get a drug that relaxes you, then use a special tool to burn the opening shut. The scar that forms makes a permanent plug. These measures increase your tear level by blocking the “drainpipe” through which tears usually go from your eye to your nose. Tear plugs are easy to remove, but sometimes they come out on their own or fall down the tear drain. They can make your eyes feel better and lower your need for artificial tears.

How Can You Prevent Eye Strain?,"Make some simple changes to these things. Your computer screen: Place it 20- from your eyes and a little below eye level. Regularly clean dust and fingerprints from the surface. Smudges can reduce contrast and create problems like glare and reflections. Choose screens that tilt and swivel. Use a glare filter for your screen. Your work environment: Change lighting to get rid of glare and harsh reflections. Use an adjustable chair. Place a document holder next to your computer screen. Make sure the lighting in the room you’re in is bright enough. You don’t want your device to be brighter than the surroundings. Your work habits: Try the rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something about for 20 seconds. Post a note that says ""Blink"" on your computer as a reminder. Take a longer break of about every spend on your devices. Youreye careroutine: Apply a washcloth soaked in warm water to tired, dry eyes (keep your eyes closed). Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry. To help prevent dry eyes while indoors, use an air cleaner to filter dust and a humidifier to add moisture to the air. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing your glasses. Get regular eye exams. You might need to use a different pair of glasses when you’re working on a computer. If you have eye fatigue or pain, see an eye doctor to make sure a deeper medical condition isn’t to blame. If the problem doesn’t go away, make an appointment for a full eye exam. The doctor can make sure your symptoms aren’t linked to a problem like aneye muscle imbalanceor dry eye. They can also tell if your glasses or contact lens prescription is up to date and good for computer use."
How Common Are Eye Allergies?,"Allergies affecting the eye are fairly common. The most common allergies are those related to pollen, particularly when the weather is warm and dry. Symptoms can include the following: Redness Itching Tearing Burning Stinging Watery discharge These symptoms, though irritating, are not usually severe enough to need medical attention. Antihistamine decongestant eye drops can reduce these symptoms, as does rain and cooler weather, which decreases the amount of pollen in the air. An increasing number of eye allergy cases are related to medications and contact lens wear. Also, animal hair and certain cosmetics, such as mascara, face creams, and eyebrow pencil, can cause allergies that affect the eye. Touching or rubbing eyes after handling nail polish, soaps, or chemicals may cause an allergic reaction. Some people have sensitivity to lip gloss and eye makeup. Allergy symptoms are temporary and can eliminated by not having contact with the cosmetic or detergent that causes it. & DNV GL Surprise Rights Drive, 84132."
How Do You Get Pink Eye?,"Several things could be to blame, but the most common causes of pink eye are: Viruses, including the kind that causes the common cold Bacteria Allergens such as pollen, dust, or smoke. It could also be due to a special type of allergy that affects some people who wearcontact lenses. Other causes include: Irritants such as shampoos, dirt, smoke, and pool chlorine A reaction to eye drops A reaction to wearing contact lens Fungi, amoebas, and parasites Conjunctivitis sometimes results from anSTD.Gonorrheacan bring on a rare but dangerous form of bacterial conjunctivitis. It can lead to vision loss if you don’t treat it.Chlamydiacan cause conjunctivitis in adults. If you have chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other bacteria in your body when you give birth, you can pass pink eye to your baby through your birth canal. Pink eye, caused by some bacteria and viruses, can spread quickly from person to person. But it isn’t a serious health risk if diagnosed promptly. However, if it happens in a newborn, tell a doctor immediately, as it might be an infection that can affect the baby’s eyesight."
How Do the Job Duties of an Ophthalmologist Differ From an Optometrist?,"Ophthalmologists can do all the above duties that optometrists can, as well as perform eye surgery. They have the additional skills to specialize in surgery for conditions like glaucoma and cataracts. They also perform corneal, vitro-retinal, eye muscle and oculoplastic surgeries. Before surgery even takes place, the ophthalmologist puts the patient through a complete exam to diagnose the issue and create the best treatment plan. An ophthalmologist can also treat more complicated eye injuries, including those dealing with other eye structures like the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva and eyelids."
How Does LASIK Work?,"LASIK uses a precise femtosecond laser to create a flap from the top layer of the cornea. The flap is gently folded back, then an Excimer laser uses cool ultraviolet light to sculpt the mid cornea under a protective layer of tissue. Once your surgeon repositions the flap, the procedure is complete. Since the surface cells of your eyes heal more quickly than any other body part, visual recovery usually occurs within there is minimal discomfort after surgery."
How Does the Eye Work?,"The human eye is a wonder of engineering. It consists of many different parts that work together to provide visual information to the brain, which then translates it into information that is useful to the body. 1. The cornea The first step in this complex process occurs when light passes through the clear slightly convex cornea at the very front of the eye. This is the transparent part of the eyeball. A thick white sheath called the sclera surrounds the rest of the eyeball. The cornea refracts light slightly. The narrow, liquid-filled space behind the cornea is called the aqueous humor. This drains through spaces at the medial corner of the eye, and is constantly renewed. 2. The iris The iris is a colored diaphragm of thin circular and longitudinal muscle fibers just behind the cornea. It has an aperture in the center. This can expand or contract to let in more or less light, respectively, depending on the light in the surroundings. This opening is called the pupil. Light passing through the cornea and the pupil falls on the anterior surface of the lens. The aqueous humor keeps the iris from sticking to the lens behind and the cornea in front. 3. The lens The lens is a clear crystalline globe which almost touches the posterior surface of the pupillary opening. The ciliary muscles are attached to the surface of the lens. The help the lens to change shape in order to focus. As they contract, they cause the lens to become more round or long, so that the rays bend more or less, according to need. If the object focused on is far away, the lens needs to bend the light rays from it more sharply, to make them fall on the center of the retina, where vision."
How Is Glaucoma Diagnosed?,"To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They’ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures: Your doctor will want to know what symptoms you’ve been experiencing and if you have any personal or family history of glaucoma. They’ll also ask for a general health assessment to determine if any other health conditions may be impacting your eye health, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. This class of tests measures your eye’s internal pressure. People with thin corneas have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. A pachymetry test can tell your doctor if your corneas are thinner than average. This test, also known as a visual field test, can tell your doctor if glaucoma is affecting your vision by measuring your peripheral, or side, vision and your central vision. If your doctor wants to monitor for gradual changes to your optic nerve, they may take photographs of your optic nerve to conduct a side-by-side comparison over time."
How Is Glaucoma Treated?,"The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don’t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments: Several medicines designed to reduce IOP are available. These medicines are available in the form of eye drops or pills, but the drops are more common. Your doctor may prescribe one or a combination of these. If a blocked or slow channel is causing increased IOP, your doctor may suggest surgery to make a drainage path for fluid or destroy tissues that are responsible for the increased fluid. Treatment for angle-closure glaucoma is different. This type of glaucoma is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment to reduce eye pressure as quickly as possible. Medicines are usually attempted first, to reverse the angle closure, but this may be unsuccessful. A laser procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy may also be performed. This procedure creates small holes in your iris to allow for increased fluid movement."
How Long Does Dry Eye Last?,"Dry eye is a chronic condition that will only go away with medication or removal of environmental factors (e.g., reduction of screen time, increased moisture in the air, etc.) Daily treatment may be needed to help ease your dry eye symptoms. You should begin using over-the-counter artificial tears or other recommended home remedies as soon as symptoms occur. Talk with your ophthalmologist if your dry eye does not improve with home care after one to two weeks. See one of our ophthalmologists if you've had signs and symptoms of dry eyes, including red, irritated, tired, or painful eyes for longer than two weeks. Your ophthalmologist will conduct an eye exam and evaluate your symptoms to help determine if more advanced treatment is necessary. Our eye care specialists recommend beginning treatment at home to see if your symptoms improve. Dry eyes may be caused by a variety or combination of factors that interfere with healthy tear film. Your eye’s tear film is made up of three layers: fatty oils, water, and mucus. This combination normally keeps the surface of your eyes naturally moisturized. An imbalance within these layers cause dry eyes. Specific causes may include: cell phone, computer, tablet, or TV screen time; low humidity climate; hormonal changes including menopause; autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis or Sjogren’s syndrome); inflammation or allergic eye disease; medications including antidepressants, antihistamines, chemotherapy, and nasal decongestants; and decreased tear production or increased tear evaporation. People with dry eye should give their health care provider a list of their current medications because some of them may increase dry eye symptoms. Since dry eye can also be a sign of more serious diseases, a complete physical examination may be necessary to diagnose any underlying conditions. If your dry eye does not resolve with home care after one."
How Long Does It Take for the Effects from Eye Dilation Drops to Wear Off?,"Side effects Purpose Tips Eye health Takeaway Getting your eyes dilated is an important part of any complete eye exam. Once your doctor puts in the dilating drops, it takes about 20– your pupils to fully open, or dilate. After your eyes are fully dilated, the effects will last for four to six hours for most people. Some people feel the effects of dilating drops for longer, including people with lighter color eyes. Dilation in children can last up to a full day after the exam. It’s impossible for your doctor to tell you exactly how long the effects of dilation will last and how severe they will be. Everyone’s eyes react differently to dilating drops. The important thing is to use caution as long as your vision is blurry or your eyes are light-sensitive."
How Long Does Pink Eye Last?,"Most cases of conjunctivitis resolve within one to two weeks. If your symptoms are mild, you may want to try one of the following remedies to reduce your discomfort at home before seeing a doctor. Apply a cool or warm compress to your eyes. Soak a clean cloth in water and wring it out before gently applying it to closed eyelids. Avoid touching both eyes with the same cloth to reduce the chance of spreading the infection from one eye to the other. Use over-the-counter artificial tear eyedrops. Antihistamine eyedrops helpful if you suffer from allergic pinkeye. Avoid other redness-reducing eye drops not specifically labeled as artificial tears. These will not help clear or treat pink eye. Reduce or stop wearing contact lenses until your pink eye goes away. If you are suffering from conjunctivitis or have other eye care concerns, contact ourOphthalmology Clinicat to schedule an appointment. Referrals are welcome, but not necessary. Please check with your insurance provider before scheduling a routine exam. Many insurance plans will cover your visit if there is a medical eye problem but may not allow for routine or non-specialty care eye exams."
How Long Is Pink Eye Contagious?,"Conjunctivitis is contagious while the eye is red (typically five to seven days). It is no longer contagious once redness or other symptoms have resolved. If your symptoms are mild, you may try home treatment or visit with your primary care physician. If your symptoms do not improve in one to two weeks, we recommend seeing one of our ophthalmologists. If symptoms are severe, see an ophthalmologist within one to two days. Our ophthalmologists will evaluate your symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and recommend proper treatment. We may also suggest further testing to determine the type of pink eye you have or rule out other diseases of the eye. Conjunctivitis is usually painless and does not affect vision. See an eye care specialist immediately if you experience intense pain, light sensitivity, or decrease in vision. Treatment for conjunctivitis focuses on relieving uncomfortable symptoms. Your treatment may vary depending on the type of conjunctivitis you have. One of our ophthalmologists may recommend: using artificial tears; applying cold or warm compresses (wet or dry) to your eye several times a day; taking a break from wearing contact lenses; antibiotics for bacterial pink eye (e.g. eye drops, oral medication, or cream); or antihistamines or other allergy care for allergic conjunctivitis."
How Long Will My Vision Correction Last?,"The correction is permanent, but it’s important to understand your eyes can change as you age."
How Safe and Effective is LASIK?,"All surgical procedures carry risks that your doctor will discuss with you. But LASIK is one of the most common surgical procedures performed and has one of thehighest patient satisfaction rates of any elective surgery at 96 percent. At the John A. Moran Eye Center, more than patients who have LASIK and PRK surgeries have20/ after their surgery."
How Should I Prepare for LASIK Eye Surgery?,"Before LASIK, you’ll meet with a coordinator or eye surgeon who will talk about what to expect during and after the procedure. They’ll ask about your medical history and do a fulleye exam. This may include tests to measure the thickness of your cornea, refraction, and eye pressure. They may map your corneas and dilate your pupils. The surgeon will answer any questions you may have. Then, you can schedule an appointment for the surgery. If you use rigid gas-permeablecontact lenses, don’t wear them for at least your evaluation. Don’t wear other types of contact lenses for at least to the evaluation. Be sure to bring your eyeglasses so the surgeon can review your prescription. On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going in, and take all of your prescribed medications. Don’t weareye makeupor bulky accessories in yourhairthat might interfere with your head position. If you’re not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to ask what you should do."
How are crossed eyes treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan for crossed eyes will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your condition. If your crossed eyes have resulted from a lazy eye, your doctor may have you wear a patch over your stronger eye to force the muscles of your weaker eye to work harder. Your doctor might also prescribe eye drops to blur the vision in your stronger eye. They can also useBotox injectionsto weaken the muscle that’s overacting and causing the eye turn. Other potential treatments include: eye exercises corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses surgery on certain eye muscles, particularly if corrective lenses haven’t corrected the condition If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, such as abrain tumoror stroke, your doctor may prescribe medication, surgery, or other treatments."
How are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?,Eye doctors do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your doctor can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. Your doctor will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.
How can I prevent cataracts?,"You can take steps to protect your eyes from cataracts: Protect your eyes from the sun.Wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block the sun. Protect your eyes from injury.While doing activities like using power tools or playing certain sports, wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from getting accidentally injured. Quit smoking.If you’re ready to quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-) for free support. Make eye-healthy food choices.Eat plenty of healthy foods — like fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains."
How can I prevent pink eye from spreading?,"Viral and bacterial pink eye spread very easily from person to person — but you can take steps to keep pink eye from spreading. If you’re around someone who has pink eye: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you don’t have soap and water, you can use hand sanitizer with alcohol in it. Wash your hands after you touch the person with pink eye or something that person used — for example, if you help put eye drops in their eyes, or put their bed sheets in the washing machine. Always wash your hands before touching your eyes. Don’t share personal items that the person with pink eye has used — including pillows, towels, makeup, or glasses. If you have pink eye: Wash your hands often with soap and water. Be extra careful about washing them after you touch your eyes or use eye drops or medicine. If you don’t have soap and water, you can use hand sanitizer with alcohol in it. Avoid touching or rubbing your eyes. If you have discharge, wash the area around your eyes times a day. Use a clean, wet washcloth or a fresh cotton ball each time. Be sure to wash your hands before and after washing your eyes. Don’t share personal items with other people — including pillows, towels, makeup, or glasses. Clean your glasses regularly. If you wear contact lenses, follow your eye doctor’s instructions for cleaning, storing, and replacing them. You can also take steps to prevent getting pink eye again: Throw away any makeup that you used while you had pink eye. This includes eye makeup, face makeup, and brushes or sponges. Throw away contact lens solution, contact lenses, and cases that you used while you had pink eye. Clean your glasses and cases."
How can I prevent retinal detachment?,"Since retinal detachment is often caused by aging, there’s often no way to prevent it. But you can lower your risk of retinal detachment from an eye injury by wearing safety goggles or other protective eye gear when doing risky activities, like playing sports. If you experience any symptoms of retinal detachment, go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away. Early treatment can help prevent permanent vision loss. It’s also important to get comprehensive dilated eye exams regularly. A dilated eye exam can help your eye doctor find a small retinal tear or detachment early, before it starts to affect your vision."
How do I find an ophthalmologist?,"Ask your doctor or optometrist for a recommendation or use the healthdirect service finder to locate an ophthalmologist in your area. The RANZCOfind an ophthalmologisttool also allows you to search for an ophthalmologist who has a special interest, such as paediatric (children’s) ophthalmology.

How do I live with vision loss from AMD?,"Not everyone with AMD develops late AMD or gets it in both eyes. But if you do, living with vision loss from AMD can be challenging. Having low vision means that even with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery, your vision loss makes it hard to do everyday tasks. The good news is, there are things that can help — like low vision devices and vision rehab services. Vision rehab can help you learn the skills you need to stay independent and active with low vision. Do you have AMD? This guide makes it easy to talk with your doctor about what this means. It includes: Information about AMD Questions for the doctor A symptom tracker."
How does Open-Angle Glaucoma develop?,"Glaucoma, is characterised by an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The trabecular meshwork is a specialized region in the eye that adjusts the IOP by regulating the aqueous humor outflow from the eye. In OAG, this meshwork is blocked, and an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor results. The accumulation of aqueous humor in the eye chamber increases the IOP to a level that leads to optic neuropathy. The exact pathogenesis of optic neuropathy is not known. However, following are the two main proposed mechanisms: Vascular dysfunction – Which results in ischemia or an inadequate blood supply to the optic nerve Mechanical dysfunction - Which occurs due to the compression of the axons by the cribriform plate."
How does astigmatism affect my vision?,"Astigmatismis a common vision condition that causes blurriness or distorted vision. It can affect the way light refracts on the retina. On a prescription, this will be written as part of the cylindrical (CYL) correction. If you see no number under CYL, it means you have no astigmatism, or the astigmatism is so slight you don’t need to correct it."
How does strabismus happen?,"Strabismus in adults can happen because of disease that affects your eye muscles (such as thyroid eye disease and myasthenia), disease that affects the nerves to your eye muscles (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) or trauma (where a physical force is applied directly to your eye). Strabismus can also be caused by trying to correct short- or long-sightedness, or by poor vision in one eye as a result of amblyopia (or ‘lazy eye’). Strabismus may not cause any symptoms. For some people it can be serious."
How is astigmatism diagnosed?,"Your optometrist orophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor)can diagnose astigmatism with an eye examination. Testing may include: vision testing to see how clearly you see (visual acuity test) measurement of the curve of your corneas measurement of how well your eyes focus light If you have any concerns about your eyesight, see your optometrist or talk to your doctor."
How is astigmatism treated?,"Your healthcare professional can treat your astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses. Most people have mild astigmatism, and this treatment is enough. If you have severe astigmatism, you may need more extensive treatment with rigid contact lenses or laser eye surgery that can adjust your cornea’s shape. Astigmatism can cause poor vision, eyestrain and headaches, which can affect your quality of life.

How is crossed eyes diagnosed?,"To prevent vision loss, early diagnosis and treatment for crossed eyes is important. If you develop symptoms of crossed eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor. They’ll perform a series of tests to check the health of your eyes that may include: a corneal light reflex test to check for crossed eyes avisual acuity testto determine how well you can read from a distance a cover/uncover test to measure your eye movement and deviation a retina exam to examine the backs of your eyes If you have other physical symptoms along with crossed eyes, your doctor may examine your brain and nervous system for other conditions. For example, they may conduct tests to check for cerebral palsy orGuillain-Barré syndrome. It’s common for newborn babies to have crossed eyes. If your baby has crossed eyes that persist beyond age, make an appointment with their doctor. Young children should undergo an eye exam before age."
How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?,"Diabetic retinopathy is diagnosed by an eye test. At the eye test the optometrist will examine your eyes. They may use eye drops to help to see the back of your eye. They may take a photo of the back of your eye. If you have diabetes, you should have your eyes checked when your diabetes is first diagnosed and then at least once every 2 years. If you experience any changes to your vision, see an optometrist orophthalmologistas soon as you can."
How is diabetic retinopathy treated?,"Treatment for diabetic retinopathy can slow or prevent vision loss. It is best to start treatment as soon as you can. Keeping your blood sugar and blood pressure under control can help. Eating ahealthy dietand getting regular exercise are useful as part of managing your diabetes. Other treatments include: laser treatment to seal leaking blood vessels and stop the growth of abnormal blood vessels surgery, such as vitrectomy medicines that can reduce swelling in the retina."
How is eye cancer diagnosed?,"If your doctor thinks you might have eye cancer, they will examine the outside of your eye and use special instruments to look inside it. If you need further tests, your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist called anophthalmologist. The specialist may check your eye using a special microscope, or take photographs of the back of your eye with a special camera. They may also refer you for other tests, including anultrasound. Sometimes, you may have abiopsy, where a small sample of tissue is removed to be checked in a laboratory. You might also have tests such as aCT scanorMRI scanto check whether the cancer has spread from your eye to other parts of your body."
How is eye cancer treated?,"The type of treatment will depend on the type of eye cancer and how far it has spread (known as itsstage). Usually, you will need surgery to remove the tumour, part of the eye or sometimes the whole eye. After the surgery, you can have an artificial eye implanted, that looks like a real eye. Other treatments may include laser therapy to destroy cancer cells. If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body, your health team may also offer you radiation therapy or other medicines. After treatment has finished, you will still need regular checks with your specialists and ongoing tests. Eye melanoma can come back in other parts of the body, so your ophthalmologist will want to review you regularly to catch any recurrence early. Most people can still see well with just one eye, if they needed one removed, though it can take a few months for your vision to adjust. You may notice ongoing problems with judging distance and seeing things at the edge of your vision (peripheral vision). If you have an artificial eye, you will need to learn to care for it. You can find more information on the websiteArtificial Eyes. After you have had treatment for cancer, it is normal to feel anxious that the cancer will return. If you are struggling, it is important to seek support from your doctor, atherapistor other people who have been through cancer.

How is glaucoma treated?,"If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you need prompt treatment to reduce the pressure. This may be done with eye drops or an intravenous medicine. You may also need surgery. Nerve cells damaged by glaucoma can’t be repaired. Treatment is designed to prevent or slow further damage, mainly by reducing the pressure in the eye. This may involve: eye drops or oral medicine laser surgeryor other surgery to open or create a new drainage channel Glaucoma surgeryis usually an outpatient or day-surgery procedure. You might have alocal anaesthetic(such as eye drops) or ageneral anaesthetic. Your surgeon will explain to you the preferred type of surgery and anaesthetic for your condition."
How is long-sightedness caused?,"The size and shape of the eye largely causes long-sightedness. When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye, and the lens. This process is known as refraction. If you have normal vision, the rays of light are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are long-sighted, the cornea is not sufficiently curved or the eye is too short, so the light rays from close objects focus behind, rather than on, the retina when the eye is resting (not actively focusing on something). Many people are slightly long-sighted and the lens automatically corrects for the refractive error by adjusting the focus to get a sharp image. People who are more long-sighted, or who do a lot of near-focus activities such as reading, need more adjustment. This means their eyes can get tired by the end of the day and they might get headaches. You have a slightly higher chance of being long-sighted if either of your parents is long-sighted."
How is long-sightedness diagnosed?,"Standard vision screening tests might not detect long-sightedness, but an optometrist or ophthalmologist can measure how well your eye focuses as part of an eye examination. Mild long-sightedness, especially in young people, might not need any treatment. If moderate to severe long-sightedness is not corrected, however, the extra focusing effort required may increase the likelihood of children developinglazy eye(amblyopia) orturned eyes(also known as a squint, or strabismus). The most common treatment is glasses, especially for reading and other near work, but sometimes also for distance. Your optometrist might recommend eye exercises. Laser refraction surgerycan correct long-sightedness, and might be suitable for adults, although it is not recommended for children. Even if you have no concerns about your vision, it is best to have your eyes checked every 2 years. Learn more here about thedevelopment and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

How is normal-tension glaucoma diagnosed?,"Medical history A complete medical history is taken with special emphasis on history of head injury. Past episodes of migraine, shock, neurological symptoms, and Raynaud's phenomenon are also investigated. The doctor may also inquire regarding the use of medications such as systemic steroids and beta blockers. This is done using an ophthalmoscope or by visual field testing. The ophthalmoscope is a non-invasive test used to examine the shape of the optic nerve. A nerve that is cupped and not a healthy pink color suggest abnormality. A visual field test provides a map of the patient’s complete field of vision. The test can detect damage to the optic nerve and is useful to detect dysfunction in central and peripheral vision. Other diagnostic tests Blood pressure should be monitored for at least exclude the possibility of nocturnal systemic hypotension, which may cause NTG Certain blood tests are carried out to further confirm the diagnosis. Tests to detect the levels of vitamin B12, folate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are conducted. Cranial imaging is done using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify any lesions that may be present in the intracranial space. To detect blood flow abnormalities, capillaroscopy is performed."
How is normal-tension glaucoma treated?,"As per the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study Group, an IOP reduction of 30% can help to slow the progression of normal-tension glaucoma. Doctors treat normal tension glaucoma by using pharmacologic agents, laser treatment, or conventional surgery. Pharmacologic agents, such as prostaglandin analogs, alpha-2 agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and miotics are normally used. Surgery is an option if medications fail to achieve the target IOP or if the patient is non-adherent to treatment. Deep sclerectomy, laser trabeculoplasty, and filtration surgery are safe and effective options. They are recommended in patients who show disease progression despite maximum tolerated medical therapy. Another important part of NTG management includes identification and treatment of underlying medical conditions such as migraine, anemia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune diseases. Neuroprotection with a calcium channel blocker helps by increasing blood flow to the damaged optic nerve. Accurate diagnosis and effective management of NTG can be challenging; however, effective IOP control can help to minimize disease progression.

How is short-sightedness caused?,"When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) and the lens. If you have normal vision, the light waves are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are short-sighted, the light waves from distant objects focus in front of, rather than on, the retina. Short-sightedness usually appears in the pre-teen years and often gets worse for a few years. It can also develop later — even in early adulthood. It is becoming more common. Myopia has been linked to spending many hours doing activities such as reading, schoolwork or using a computer, while spending less time outdoors. You can also inherit short-sightedness from your parents."
How is short-sightedness diagnosed?,An eye test using an eye chart will allow an optometrist or ophthalmologist to diagnose short-sightedness. Children should have their vision checked when they start both primary and secondary schools.
How is short-sightedness treated?,"Short-sightedness is usually corrected with prescription glasses. Contact lenses are also an option, but generally not for children.Laser refractive eye surgeryis now also common, but is only appropriate for adults. Some research suggests that certain treatments might be able to slow the progression of short-sightedness in children. If you want to know more about this, talk to your optometrist or doctor.

How is traumatic glaucoma diagnosed?,"Doctors usually start by carrying out a complete eye examination to assess the extent of the damage. After confirming that the eye is not ruptured, the doctor examines the IOP and the angle structures. The angle structures are measured using a slit lamp microscope and a gonioscope. Imaging can also be done performed with ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). If the optic nerve show signs of glaucoma, the following additional tests are carried out. Optic nerve thickness measurements Visual field testing and screening for early visual field loss."
How is traumatic glaucoma treated?,"The treatment goal for all forms of glaucoma is lowering IOP to less than . The pressure should be lowered in such a way that the optic nerve is not further damaged. Does cannabis use impact the risk of glaucoma? New study investigates Ultra-processed foods linked to higher glaucoma risk, study warns The treatment strategy for traumatic glaucoma includes a combination of pharmacologic agents with or without surgery. Pharmacologic agents used to treat traumatic glaucoma include beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogues, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Beta-blockers are the first choice agents. They decrease IOP by reducing the aqueous fluid inflow. Prostaglandin analogues relax the eye muscles and facilitate outflow of fluids, which, in turn, reduces IOP. Alpha-adrenergic agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease the rate of aqueous humor production. Steroids can help treat inflammation. Surgery is considered when maximally tolerated medical therapy has failed and when the risk of progressive visual loss outweighs the risk of surgery. Argon laser trabeculoplasty, alternative laser procedures, and filtration surgery are possible surgical options.If left untreated, traumatic glaucoma can cause permanent, irreversible damage to vision. Therefore, an eye examination is highly recommended following injury.

How is uveitis diagnosed?,"As there may be no symptoms, all children with JIA need to be regularly assessed by an ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor). The ophthalmologist will look into the back of your child’s eyes with a special microscope called a slit lamp. Some children may be assessed by an optometrist, particularly older children (e.g. over age). How often each child needs to be seen will be decided by their ophthalmologist or optometrist. For children without uveitis they may be seen initially every three months then over time this may extend to less often (e.g. six monthly). Children with active uveitis may need to be seen much more often by an ophthalmologist but your child’s doctor will direct this plan."
How is uveitis treated?,"If uveitis occurs, the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist will work together to treat your child to prevent permanent eye damage. Treatment may require steroid eye drops. Sometimes other eye drops are required. If the eye drops don’t control the uveitis or the uveitis is severe, your child may require other medicines by mouth or injection. These medicines aim to suppress their immune system and may include methotrexate and TNF blockers. Some children who develop complications of severe uveitis may require eye surgery to improve their vision and protect their eyes."
How much will an ophthalmologist cost?,"Thecostsof an ophthalmologist visit vary greatly, depending on the type of care you receive. Factors include whether it’s inhospital, whether you haveprivate health insurance, and what the ophthalmologistcharges. If you see an ophthalmologist in their rooms, thenMedicarewill cover: all of the costs if theybulk bill some of the costs if they don’t bulk bill You can't use private health insurance for out of hospital care. If you are a public patient in a public hospital or clinic and use Medicare, the treatment is free. If you use private health insurance for treatment in either a public hospital or a private hospital or clinic, you will be charged by the ophthalmologist and by the hospital. You might also becharged for diagnostic testing, such aspathology tests,x-raysand other forms of imaging (such as anMRI,PETorCT scan), and by other doctors who provide you care, such as an anaesthetist. If you have private health insurance, it may cover some of these costs. It can be expensive to see a specialist, such as an ophthalmologist. Before you go for the first time, ask the ophthalmologist or their staff about the costs. You can also ask what Medicare will cover. If you plan to use private health insurance, you can also contact your health fund. If the costs are too high, you can: ask the ophthalmologist or their staff for a reduced rate consider another ophthalmologist or health service talk to your GP about other options such as a different type of treatment."
How often should you get your eyes checked?,"Your prescription can change, so it’s important to get regular eye exams. Adults ages with vision problems should get their eyes checked at least every two years. Adults older than them checked once a year. If you’re an adult with no vision problems, get your eyes checked every five years until age 30, and then at least every years from age . After age 65, you’ll need regular eye exams at least every two years. Let your doctor know if you notice any changes to your vision and need to be seen more often. At checkups, your doctor will also screen for eye conditions like glaucoma, which can be treated if caught early. Your vision prescription can change over time. It’s important to get regular eye checkups so your glasses and contact prescription stays up to date. Your eye doctor can also check for common eye conditions that may require additional treatment or correction.

How will my baby’s doctor check for ROP?,"If your baby is at risk for ROP, they’ll need a dilated eye exam a few weeks after they’re born — usually between weeks after birth. Ask your doctor when your baby needs an eye exam before you leave the hospital. During the exam, the eye doctor will give your baby some eye drops to dilate (widen) their pupils. The doctor will check every part of your baby’s eye for problems — especially the retina. The eye doctor will decide if your baby needs a follow-up exam based on what they see during the first exam. If your baby needs follow-up care, the doctor will check their eyes again every weeks until they aren’t worried about the risk for retinal detachment. It’s important to get your baby’s follow-up exams on schedule. That way, the doctor can catch ROP in an early stage and start your baby’s treatment."

Is astigmatism genetic?,"Experts think the condition is genetic, meaning if you have it, you're more likely to pass it on to your children. Astigmatism happens when your cornea is irregularly shaped, bending light in one direction more than another and leaving only part of an object in focus. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Most people are born with it, but experts don’t know why. You can also get it after an eye injury, an eye disease, or surgery. Rarely, a condition calledkeratoconuscan cause astigmatism by making the clear front part of your eye (your cornea) thinner and more cone-shaped. You’ll probably need contacts (but not glasses) to see clearly. You can’t get astigmatism from reading in low light or sitting too close to the TV. Astigmatism symptoms come on slowly. Go to aneye doctorif you notice changes in your vision.You’ll need a complete eye exam. Your doctor will test the sharpness of your eyesight by asking you to read an eye chart. Astigmatism tests Your doctor will also use tools to measure your vision, including: Phoropter.You look through a series of lenses to find the ones that give you the clearest vision. Keratometer.This machine measures the bend in the center of yourcornea. It finds the steepest and flattest curves. The measurements tell your doctor about the shape of your cornea and how well it can focus. Autorefractor.This device shines light into your eye and measures how it changes as it bounces off the back. This gives your doctor an idea of which lenses you need. Corneal topographer.This technology gives the most detailed information about your cornea’s shape. The doctor tells you to look at a specific point. Meanwhile, the device collects thousands of tiny measurements. A computer builds a color map of your cornea from the data. Your doctor will refer to it."
Is my baby at risk for ROP?,"Babies are at risk for ROP if they’re born before pregnancy or weighless than about birth. If your baby is at risk, an eye specialist will check them for ROP.

Is pink eye contagious?,"Pink eye may be contagious, depending on the type. Cases caused by a viral or bacterial infection can spread to other people, but those caused by allergies or irritants don’t. Pink eye symptoms may be the same regardless of their cause. It's hard to know which type of conjunctivitis you have without your doctor testing it. So, regularly wash your hands and avoid touching your eyes to prevent spreading or catching it. Viral pink eye Viral pink eye is the most common and may be the most contagious form. It's usually caused by the virus that causes the common cold. It tends to start in one eye, causing lots of tears and a watery discharge. Within 24-48 hours, it affects the other eye, too. You might feel aswollen lymph nodein front of your ear or under your jawbone. You may also have cold symptoms such as a fever, sore throat, and runny nose. Viral pink eye has no cure but will go away on its own. Your symptoms may worsen in the first 3-5 days, but you’ll get better within 1-3 weeks. Bacterial pink eye Bacteria that cause pink eye include: Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Bacterial strains affect children more often than adults. These infections spread easily and are typically seen from December through April. Bacterial pink eye usually infects one eye but can show up in both. Your eye will release a lot of yellow, white, or green pus andmucus.If treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment, it goes away quickly without causing eye problems. Allergic conjunctivitis Allergic pink eye may occur when allergens in the air, such as dust mites, cat dander, and pollen, enter the eye.

Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: What’s the Difference?,"Optometrist Ophthalmologist Optician Bottom line An optometrist treats your eyes. In contrast, an ophthalmologist focuses on doing surgical procedures for eye conditions, while an optician helps you fit eyeglasses and other vision-correcting devices. If you’ve ever had to search for an eye care doctor, you’re likely aware that there are several different types of eye specialists. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians are all professionals who specialize in eye care. In this article, we will explore the education requirements, salary, scope of practice, and services that optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians provide. We will also discuss how to choose the best eye-care professional for your needs."
"Optometrists, orthoptists and ophthalmologists: What’s the difference?","Optometrists are different from ophthalmologists. They can prescribe and fit glasses and contact lenses. They are also trained in screening for serious eye conditions such as glaucoma, but they are not doctors. Optometrists can give advice on visual problems and treat minor eye problems but will refer you to an ophthalmologist for the diagnosis and treatment of more serious eye conditions. Like optometrists, orthoptists are not doctors. They are allied healthcare professionals who specialise in assessing and managing eye movement disorders, such as double vision and squints (strabismus) in children and adults. Their role includes caring for people with eye diseases, such asdiabetic retinopathy, as well as people with low vision and neurological vision disorders. Ophthalmologists often work in teams with other healthcare professionals to provide the best care for their patients. Good vision for lifeprovides advice for care of your eyes, problems and diseases.

Should You Get Your Eyes Dilated?,"A thorough, dilated exam lets your ophthalmologist do a complete exam of the retina. This is important to do throughout your life because several eye diseases and conditions are detected at their earliest stages during a thorough eye exam. & DNV GL Surprise Rights Drive, 84132."
Should You Seek Help for Eye Floaters?,"Eye floaters are shadows of the cell strands that are present in the vitreous of the eye. Though many floaters do not cause harm to the affected individual, there are some conditions in which an individual should seek physician help, as floaters in these situations could indicate benign diseases. Some floaters can also be a sign of vision-threatening diseases. When the disease is diagnosed and treated, it can restore eye health and also cure floaters. Floaters can be due to ocular or non-ocular reasons. In any event, if an individual suddenly experiences any one of the below symptoms, it is a warning sign to consult a physician: New floaters obstructing vision Increase in the number of floaters Light flashes with or without floaters Low vision Shadows in the peripheral vision Dark or gray shapes in the sides of the vision Increase in the size of floaters. As humans age, the gel-like vitreous humor that maintains the shape of the eye gradually liquefies. Some of the gel-like particles float in the liquid consistency, which causes the retina to cast shadows of these shapes, which leads to the appearance of floaters. Floaters are most common in old age and are visible in lighter backgrounds. Moreover, floaters might stay in the vision for a few weeks and when the brain gets adapted to seeing the floaters, an individual may not notice them. However, if an individual is over the age of are new floaters obstructing the ability of the vision, it is critical to seek medical attention. The gel-like vitreous humor will gradually shrink due to age and will detach from the retina, a condition which is referred to as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). During the detachment process, some debris will stay in the vitreous and could be the cause of floaters. Usually,."
WHAT ARE CATARACTS?,"Cataract Surgery Understanding Cataracts Femtosecond Laser Intraocular Lens Treatment A cataract is a thickening and hardening of the lens in the eye. As the lens in your eye thickens, the naturally transparent lens becomes clouded or opaque. In its early stages, a cataract may not cause a problem; the cloudiness may affect only a small part of the lens. However, as the cataract grows larger it prevents light from reaching your retina. As less light reaches your retina, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and vision may become dull and blurry. Cataract surgeryis one of the best ways to treat advanced cataracts. A cataract, a clouding of the natural lens of the eye, blurs vision and can eventually lead to blindness. To improve your vision with cataract surgery, your doctor removes the clouded lens and inserts a clear artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, or IOL, in its place. Cataracts don’t return, so cataract surgery can improve the quality of your vision for years to come. The Moran Eye Center offers the most advanced laser cataract surgery available and our cataract surgery team is dedicated to excellence in both the consultation and treatment of all types of cataracts. Our cataract surgeons use only state-of-the-art equipment and have experience with complicated cataract surgery cases. This helps to ensure exact diagnoses and best practices in medical and surgical care. Scientists believe there are several contributing factors in developing cataracts, the first one being age; given enough time, everyone will mostly likely develop cataracts. However, about one in six people over the age of US has a cataract. Other contributing factors include the following: Smoking Diabetes Excessive exposure to sunlight Steroid use Diuretic use Certain major tranquilizers For several of the potential causes listed (i.e., steroids, diuretics, and/or major tranquilizers), additional research."

What Are Floaters and Flashes?,"What Are Floaters?Floaters look like small specks, dots, circles, lines or cobwebs in your field of vision. While they seem to be in front of your eye, they are floating inside. Floaters are tiny clumps of gel or cells inside thevitreousthat fills your eye. What you see are the shadows these clumps cast on yourretina.You usually notice floaters when looking at something plain, like a blank wall or a blue sky.As we age, our vitreous starts to thicken or shrink. Sometimes clumps or strands form in the vitreous. If the vitreous pulls away from the back of the eye, it is calledposterior vitreous detachment. Floaters more often happen with posterior vitreous detachment, but you can also get them without one. They are not serious, and they tend to fade and become less noticeable over time. Severe floaters can be removed by surgery, but this has risks and is seldom necessary or recommended.You are more likely to get floaters if you:arenearsighted(you need glasses to see far away)have hadsurgery for cataractshave hadinflammation (swelling)inside the eyeWhat Are Flashes?Flashes can look like flashing lights or lightning streaks in your field of vision. Some people compare them to seeing “stars” after being hit on the head. You might see flashes on and off for weeks, or even months. Flashes happen when the vitreous rubs or pulls on your retina.As people age, it is common to see flashes occasionally. Any new floaters or flashes should be examined by your ophthalmologist.Flashes and MigrainesSometimes people have light flashes that look like jagged lines or heat waves. These can appear in one or both eyes and may last up to 20 minutes. This type of flash may be caused by amigraine, and can be described as seeing “flickering or twinkling lights” in your peripheral vision. A migraine is a."
What Are Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments?,"Since the procedure is used to flatten a steep cornea, nearsighted patients benefit the most. The level of nearsightedness should be mild, and the patients should have little or no astigmatism. The advantage of this procedure is that the ring segments can be removed or exchanged. INTACS are also used as a treatment for keratoconus patients. Pros: For patients with progressive keratoconus, Intacs may defer a corneal transplant Reversible Patients may achieve a better fit and hence a more comfortable fit with their contact lenses Cons: Postoperative discomfort/pain for one to four days Fluctuating vision for weeks to months after the procedure Vision may not improve or change."
What Are the Job Duties of an Optometrist?,"When someone starts having vision trouble, they see an optometrist for basic vision care. Optometrists do routine vision checks and tests, examine other parts of the visual system and diagnose and treat minor eye problems, diseases and injuries. If necessary, the optometrist prescribes glasses or contact lenses, finding the right vision correction level and fit for each person. They also do minor surgical procedures, offer pre- and post-op care for more involved surgeries with an ophthalmologist and promote general eye health and care."
What Are the Symptoms of Glaucoma?,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision. Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: severe eye pain nausea vomiting redness in your eye sudden vision disturbances seeing colored rings around lights sudden blurred vision."
What Are the Types of Glaucoma?,"Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are: Open-angle, or chronic, glaucoma has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. This loss may be so slow that your vision can suffer irreparable damage before any other signs become apparent. According theNational Eye Institute (NEI), this is the most common type of glaucoma. If the flow of your aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked, the rapid buildup of fluid may cause a severe, quick, and painful increase in pressure. Angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency situation. You should call your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, and blurred vision. Children born with congenital glaucoma have a defect in the angle of their eye, which slows or prevents normal fluid drainage. Congenital glaucoma usually presents with symptoms, such as cloudy eyes, excessive tearing, or sensitivity to light. Congenital glaucoma can run in families. Secondary glaucoma is often a side effect of injury or another eye condition, such as cataracts or eye tumors. Medicines, such as corticosteroids, may also cause this type of glaucoma. Rarely, eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma. In some cases, people without increased eye pressure develop damage to their optic nerve. The cause of this isn’t known. However, extreme sensitivity or a lack of blood flow to your optic nerve may be a factor in this type of glaucoma."
What Bacteria Causes Pink Eye?,"Pink eye is usually a viral infection (viral conjunctivitis) caused by a cold virus. However, pink eye from bacteria (bacterial conjunctivitis) is most commonly caused by exposure to staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria from your own skin or respiratory system. Your ophthalmologist will conduct an exam to determine the type of pink eye you have and recommend proper treatment. Allergic conjunctivitis (allergy-related pink eye) is common among people who suffer from allergic reactions to: pollen, animal dander, dust, chemicals, makeup, contact lens solution, or eye drops. Allergic conjunctivitis may be accompanied by watery discharge from the eye. Unlike viral and bacterial pink conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious and always affects both eyes. Your conjunctivitis symptoms may vary depending on the cause and severity, such as sticky matting or crusting over your eye after waking; feeling like something is in your eye; or intense itching due to allergies."
What Can You Do About a Droopy Upper Eyelid?,"When the upper eyelid droops over the eye, it's called ptosis. Children may be born with the condition and adults may develop it with age. It also could develop as a side effect after certain surgeries, diseases, or tumors."
What Causes Corneal Infections?,"Corneal infections can be caused by many things. Sometimes the cornea is damaged after a foreign object has penetrated the tissue, maybe from a poke in the eye. Bacteria or fungi from a contaminated contact lens can also pass into the cornea. These things can cause painful inflammation and corneal infections called keratitis. Keratitis can reduce visual clarity, produce corneal discharges, and possibly erode the cornea. Corneal infections can also lead to corneal scarring, which can impair vision and may require a corneal transplant. As a general rule, the deeper the corneal infection, the more severe the symptoms and complications. Most corneal infections, however, generally happen to individuals that wearcontact lenses. View Video Minor corneal infections are commonly treated with anti-bacterial eye drops. If the problem is severe, your doctor may proscribe intensive antibiotic or anti-fungal treatment for the infection as well as steroid eye drops to reduce inflammation. Frequent visits to an eye care professional may be necessary for several months to eliminate the problem. & DNV GL Surprise Rights Drive, 84132."
What Causes Dry Eyes?,"Even when you’re happy, your eyes are full of tears. They provide moisture and lubrication to help you see and keep your peepers comfortable. What’s in a tear? They’re a mix of: Water, for moisture Oils, for lubrication Mucus, for even spreading Antibodies and special proteins that keep infection at bay The ingredients come from special glands around your eye. Dry eyes often mean your tear system is out of whack. When tears don’t provide enough moisture, you might notice: A gritty feeling Feeling like there’s something in your eye Itching Redness Blurry vision Light sensitivity Sometimes, dry eyes create too many tears. This confusing condition is calledreflex tearing. It happens because the lack of moisture irritates your eye. It sends a distress signal through your nervous system for more lubrication. Your body sends a flood of tears to try to make up for the dryness. It’s a lot like what happens when you get sand in your eye and it runs. But these tears are mostly water, so they don’t act like normal tears. They can wash debris away, but they can’t coat your eye’s surface."
What Causes Dry Eyes?,"Sometimes, there's a lack of balance in your tear-flow system. Or your air conditioner, heater, or other things around you could dry out your tear film. Other causes include: The natural aging process, especially menopause Side effects of certain drugs likeantihistamines Diseases that affect your ability to make tears, like Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and collagen vascular diseases Problems that don’t allow your eyelids to close the way they should."
What Causes Eye Floaters?,"Eye floaters (myodesopsias) emerge as a consequence of opacities developed in the vitreous fluid of the eye. The fibers in the vitreous create shadows on the retina and these shadows are called floaters. Based on the size and shape of the fibers, floaters may appear as black spots, thread-like, or a small piece of cobweb. When the eye moves, these fibers move in the vitreous fluid and become visible. Floaters are dark or semi-transparent and are visible while staring at a surface that is light-colored or when exposed to bright light. When we try to look at a floater, it will tend to move away in the direction in which the eye is being moved. Eye floaters showing whilst looking at a blue sky.Image Credit: meyerandmeyer / Shutterstock.com A human eye is comprised of 1) anterior chamber 2) vitreous chamber and 3) posterior chamber. The vitreous chamber covers approximately 80% of the eyeball. The vitreous humor or vitreous is a colorless fluid present in between the retina and lens in the eye. Vitreous humor is comprised of 99% of water, and the remaining 1% is a mixture of collagen fibers, large molecules of hyaluronic acid, hyalocytes, inorganic salts, sugar, and ascorbic acid. The fluid has a gel-like consistency and helps to maintain the spherical shape of the eye. The pressure of the fluid is responsible for keeping the retina in position. When the posterior vitreous cortex is separated from the internal limiting lamina of the retina, we term the condition as Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD). At a young age, the vitreous will be a gel-like substance. As a person grows older, the vitreous gel will lose its gel-like property slowly. It becomes watery, losing its shape and detaches from the retina, eventually causing PVD. At this stage, patients may experience."
What Causes Glaucoma?,"Some people have glaucoma that develops because of inflammation or a traumatic injury. In most cases, however, glaucoma develops with no known cause. You may be more likely to develop glaucoma if any of these traits apply to you: You are . You are a long-term user of steroids or cortisone. You are of African, Hispanic, or Mediterranean descent. You are severely nearsighted. The disease is also more likely to occur in people with certain health problems: Diabetes High blood pressure (hypertension) Sleep apnea Very low blood pressure Diagnosing glaucoma may take several tests. Your initial visit may be lengthy. First, we will ask you for a complete medical history. Then, our specialists use several tests designed to detect glaucoma in its early stages: Visual acuity test: The common eye chart test helps us measure your vision at various distances. Slit lamp examination: We will use a microscope to examine the front part of your eye. Tonometry: We will measure your eye pressure using brief puffs of air, a small probe, or an electronic device. Pupil dilation: We will place eye drops that widen your pupil. This helps to examine your retina (tissue layer at the back of your eye) and optic nerve (nerve that carries information from your eyes to your brain). Optical coherence tomography (OCT): An OCT uses light waves to take pictures of your retina and create a map of the optic nerve. This can help us measure the thickness of your optic nerve. Visual field test: You will place your chin in a machine where you look at flashing lights in the center and on the sides of a screen. You will push a button when you see the lights. This test can help measure your peripheral vision. Pachymetry:An electronic device that measures the thickness of."
What Causes Glaucoma?,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye. What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role: dilating eye drops blocked or restricted drainage in your eye medications, such as corticosteroids poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve high or elevated blood pressure."
What Causes Retinal Detachment?,"The retina is the layer of the eye that contains light-sensitive nerve cells or photoreceptors. It receives and transmits light stimuli to the brain, enabling the body to see. It lines the inside of the eye, resting upon a pigmented layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This nourishes and renews the retinal photopigments, maintaining normal visual function. When the retina pulls away from the underlying RPE it is called a retinal detachment. There are three types of retinal detachment, as described below: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment:This is caused by a tear or hole in the retina which allows fluid from the vitreous chamber to seep underneath the retinal layers and separate it or peel it off the RPE. This is the most common type. Tractional retinal detachment:In this case the scar tissue on the retinal surface contracts, pulling against the RPE and creating retinal detachment. This is more often seen in diabetics, those with a history of prior retinal surgery, and inflammatory conditions which result in scarring. Serous/exudative retinal detachment:This is caused by exudation of fluid under the intact retina, causing its detachment from the RPE. This is seen in inflammatory or traumatic conditions, which increase the rate of fluid formation. In either case, an increase in the number of floaters, and the appearance of light flashes in the peripheral visual fields, may occur. Floaters are dark specks which dart about in the field of vision following the direction of eye movement. They are shadows cast by the clumps of solid material in the vitreous. Light flashes are considered a more ominous symptom. Also called photopsia, they occur because the traction stimulates the nerve fibers leading from the sensory cells in the retina. They may mark a higher probability of serious central vision loss. A third symptom is the descent."
What Does Pink Eye Look Like?,"Conjunctivitis appears as increased redness (pink) in the white part of the eye. Visible clear, watery, or mucus-like discharge may also be present. Other visible marks or discoloration in your eyes may be a sign of more serious disease and should be examined as soon as possible."
What Does an Optometrist Do?,"Optometrists are self-reliant superior healthcare specialists, who are licensed to detect, diagnose, and provide treatment for diseases and disorders related to the eyes and the visual system. Optometrists were formerly known as ophthalmic opticians. They performed all the work that was performed by ophthalmologists, except surgery. Optometrists work in hospitals, clinics, the ophthalmic industry, teaching institutions, and on research projects; however, they majorly contribute their services in clinical practice, hospitals, and public health centers. Clinically, optometrists aim to provide solutions to patients with eye disorders. First, patients are subjected to general eye examinations in which the optometrist takes the patient’s medical history of his eye problems. Following this, the eyes are checked for refractive errors and a visual acuity test is carried out to evaluate the eyesight. if required, spectacles or contact lenses of the calculated refractive status of the eyes are prescribed, in order to attain proper vision.A Day in the Life - OptometristPlayRole of optometrists in clinical practiceClinically, optometrists aim to provide solutions to patients with eye disorders.

What Happens During LASIK Eye Surgery?,"Your doctor will give you drops to numb youreyes. You can also ask for a mild sedative. They’ll use an instrument called a microkeratome or a femtosecond laser to make a thin flap in your cornea. They’ll peel it back and use another laser to reshape the tissue underneath. Then, they’ll put the flap back in place, and the surgery is done. The LASIK procedure itself usually takes about 20 minutes. Plan to have someone drive you home after surgery."
What Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?,"Age-related macular degeneration, also called AMD, is the deterioration of the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is the part of the retina which is responsible for our central vision and our ability to see color and fine detail when looking directly at an object. AMD is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 55. In the early stages of AMD, there is little or no vision loss. As the disease advances, images can become blurred, distorted, or a dark or empty area can appear in the center of the vision. AMD does not cause total blindness because side vision is not affected.> There is some good news relating to macular degeneration. With regular checkups, early diagnosis, and new treatment options, doctors are now able to prevent or minimize the damage that age-related macular degeneration can cause to vision. The most significant symptom of macular degeneration is blurred or distorted central vision. Over time, macular degeneration can affect vision by forming a blurred, darkened, or empty area in the center of vision, or it can distort one’s surroundings, most noticeably in the appearance of straight lines. Macular degeneration may also cause colors to become less vivid. Blurred or distorted central vision can cause an inability to perform tasks that require precision, like driving a car. Fortunately, this disease does not cause total blindness because side vision is not affected. If macular degeneration occurs in only one eye, the symptoms of the disease may not be noticed right away, as the good eye compensates for the bad eye. It is essential to take these symptoms seriously and to speak with an eye care professional immediately if they are developed. The most common form of age-related macular degeneration is called the dry form."
What Is Astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a condition in which your eye, especially your cornea or the clear front part of the eyeball, isn’t completely round. Almost all of us have some degree of astigmatism. Ideally, an eyeball is shaped like a perfectly round ball. Light comes into it and bends evenly, which gives you a clear view. But if your cornea is shaped more like a football, light gets bent more in one direction than another. That means only part of an object is in focus. Things at a distance may look blurry and wavy. It’s common to have astigmatism along withnearsightedness(myopia) orfarsightedness(hyperopia). These three conditions are called refractive errors because they involve how your eyes bend (or refract) light. Astigmatism is fairly easy for an eye doctor to fix with glasses, contacts, or surgery. Symptoms of astigmatismmay include: Blurry or distorted vision Eyestrain Headaches Trouble seeingat night."
What Is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that causes eye problems. It damages the blood vessels inside the retina and can cause blurred vision, vision floaters, and difficulty seeing colors. If left untreated, it can cause blindness. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, is a form of diabetic retinopathy. NDPR occurs when diabetes damages small blood vessels within the retina. These vessels start to leak both fluid and blood, gradually causing the retina to thicken or swell. Over time, the swelling, or edema, thickens the retina causing the vision to become blurred. Another form of diabetic retinopathy is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or PDR, which occurs when new and fragile blood vessels grow abnormally from the retina into the vitreous. This can result in bleeding, scarring, and contraction of the vitreous, which may lead to retinal detachment. PDR can cause severe vision problems, and it can even lead to blindness. It must be treated as soon as possible. Diabetic Retinopathy: PDR."
What Is Electrophysiology?,"Electrophysiology is used to diagnose and follow progression of disorders affecting vision similar to the manner electrocardiograms (ECGs) are used to monitor heart disease. The retina of the eye, optic pathways in the brain and visual cortex create electrical signals that can be recorded directly from the eye or extracted by computer from brain electrical signals recorded from the scalp, similar to recording electroencephalograms (EEG). Moran Eye Center electrophysiologists are leaders in the field and are actively involved in research to improve electrophysiological testing. Learn more about electrophysiological testing: Electroretinograms Multifocal electroretinograms Visually evoked potentials Multifocal visually evoked potentials Electro-oculograms Auditory brainstem responses Dark adaptometry Saccadic velocities The electroretinogram (ERG) is an electrical response of the retina to photic stimulation. The ERG is similar to an electrocardiogram in that it shows the electrical health of the retina, similar to the ECG reflecting the health of the heart muscles. The eye does not beat, so the retina must be stimulated to start its electrical response. A flash of light or bright appearance of a pattern sparks a biphasic negative/positive waveform. Chemical changes in the retina start in 18 nanoseconds. The a-wave is the initial electrochemical discharge of the rods (night receptors) and cones (day and color receptors) and is fully formed in 10–15 milliseconds. The b-wave is generated by the mid-retina where editing begins before electrochemical signals are sent into the brain via the optic nerves. There are several methods used to record ERGs depending on whether one is most interested in the global health of the retina or whether one wishes to map the retina using multifocal patterns to determine areas producing blind spots. View information on the clinical applications of electroretinograms. Multifocal electroretinograms are used to map the retina-detecting blind spots and are usually best to detect drug toxicity."
What Is Eye Strain?,"Your eyes are burning, itchy, and tired. It’s a common condition but rarely serious. You can take simple steps to prevent or ease this problem.

What Is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the part of your eye that carries information defining what you see to your brain. Your brain then turns the information into images. Though there are probably several factors that contribute to glaucoma, the one we understand the best is eye pressure. With glaucoma, fluid builds up in your eye and increases pressure. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve over time. Without treatment, optic nerve damage can cause vision loss and eventual blindness. Around in the United States have glaucoma. The disease mostly affects adults, but glaucoma can occur in people of any age. Glaucoma is hereditary (tends to run in families). You should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist for glaucoma screening if you have a family member with glaucoma. Acataractis a disease affecting your lens, the clear curved structure at the front of your eye behind your pupil. Glaucoma affects your optic nerve. Both cataracts and glaucoma can cause vision problems. Cataracts tend to affect your general, overall vision, while glaucoma affects your outer (peripheral) vision first then moves inward. There are multipletypes of glaucoma: Childhood glaucoma Congenital glaucoma Low-tension or normal-tension glaucoma Narrow-angle glaucoma(angle-closure glaucoma) Ocular hypertension Open angle glaucoma Primary glaucoma Secondary glaucoma."
What Is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a condition that damages your eye's optic nerve, and it gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your eye. Glaucoma tends to run in families. You usually don’t get it until later in life. The increased pressure in your eye, called intraocular pressure, can damage your optic nerve that sends images to your brain. If the damage worsens, glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. What glaucoma looks like within the eye. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. Visit your eye doctor regularly so they can diagnose and treat glaucoma before you have long-term vision loss. If you lose vision, it can’t be brought back, but lowering eye pressure can help you keep the sight you have. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regulareye examsare able to keep their vision. The fluid inside your eye, called aqueous humor, usually flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel. If this channel gets blocked or the eye is producing too much fluid, the liquid builds up. Sometimes, experts don’t know what causes this blockage, but it can be inherited, meaning it’s passed from parents to children. Less-common causes of glaucoma include a blunt or chemical injury to your eye, severeeye infection, blocked blood vessels inside your eye, and inflammatory conditions. It’s rare, but eye surgery to correct another condition can sometimes bring it on. It usually affects both eyes, but it may be worse in one than the other. Glaucoma mostly affects adults older than 40, but young adults, children, and even infants can have it. African Americans tend to get it more often, at a younger age, and with morevision loss.

What Is Strabismus?,"Strabismus is a common eye-movement disorder where the eyes are not aligned correctly. Either one or both eyes may turn inward, outward, up, or down, which is why strabismus is also called wandering eye or cross eyes. In most cases strabismus is caused by abnormal neuromuscular control of eye movement. Strabismus can also be caused by poor muscle strength. Strabismus affects adults and children in different ways. Symptoms of strabismus in children are usually mild. Parents may notice that children tilt their head to one side to compensate or close and cover the deviating eye. Diagnosing this condition early is very important to reduce the loss of the child’s vision. Symptoms of strabismus in adults may be more severe. Patients with this condition lose their binocular vision, which can cause double vision and loss of depth perception. As a result, patients may suffer from headaches or eye strain.

What Is Uveitis?,"Uveitis is a condition that occurs in the uvea, or the middle area of the eye. Because the uvea contains the blood vessels that supply nutrients to the eye, any form of uveitis may be serious and may be a symptom of other serious conditions. There are three types of uveitis: Anterior uveitisis the most common form of uveitis. It affects the iris and ciliary body and may be associated with autoimmune disorders such as various types of arthritis. Iritis may develop suddenly and may last up to eight weeks, even with treatment, or may have a chronic course, requiring prolonged treatment. Intermediate uveitisis an inflammation of the middle portion of the eye, the vitreous gel, and the retina. This may develop suddenly and last several months or have a chronic, indolent course. Posterior uveitisaffects the back of the eye and involves the retina, choroid, or both. It may progress quickly, making it difficult to treat. Retinitis may be caused by viruses, such as shingles or herpes simplex virus, and bacterial infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis. Choroiditis is an inflammation of the layer beneath the retina. It may also be caused by an infection, such as tuberculosis. Retinitis and choroiditis can also be caused by an autoimmune disease. However, in a large number of cases, the cause of uveitis is not known. Symptoms of uveitis may include the following: Eye redness and irritation. Blurred vision. Eye pain or soreness. Increased sensitivity to light. Floating spots before the eyes. Flashing lights. Complications of uveitis may include glaucoma, cataracts, abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eyes that interfere with vision, fluid within the retina (edema), retinal detachment, membrane formation anywhere in the eye, low pressure, all of which may result in vision loss. Uveitis has many potential causes, including the."
What Is a Stye?,"If you notice a bump that looks like a pimple on your upper or lower eyelid, it might be a stye. It's an infection in the oil glands around the eyelids and most often shows up next to your eyelashes. Usually, this red, painful bump filled with pus lasts a few days, then bursts and heals. But in some cases, you'll need treatment for the infection. You usually get a stye in one eye at a time. Some people get them repeatedly. Chalazion vs. stye A chalazion is a different kind of eyelid bump. It most often shows up on the underside of your upper eyelid. But you can get one on the lower lid, too. It's caused by blocked oil glands in your lid, not an infection. But it can sometimes form after a stye. Unlike a stye, it's usually not painful. Chalazia (the plural of chalazion) often last longer than styes, for weeks or months, but usually go away on their own. Stye vs. pink eye Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is inflammation of the membrane lining your inner eyelid and the surface of your eyeball. The telltale sign is that the whites of your eye look reddish or pink. But you can also get swollen, crusty eyelids. Like a stye, pink eye can be caused by a bacterial infection, but it's usually caused by a virus. Unlike a stye, pink eye is contagious. Styes can form when oil glands in your eyelash follicles get infected. (Photo credit: Dubovdaniilyu/Dreamstime) There are two types of styes: External stye.This is the most common type. It forms on the outer edge of your lid, near your lashes. It's caused by infection in a tiny oil gland in an eyelash follicle. Internal stye.These form on the inside of your eyelid. The cause is."
What Is a Stye?,"Stye: Overview A stye is a red, painful, pimple-like bump that forms on the eyelid or eyelash line.

What Should I Expect After LASIK Eye Surgery?,"Your eyes will be dry, even though they may not feel that way. Your doctor will give you prescription eyedrops to prevent infection andinflammation, as well as drops to keep your eyes moist. You might have a brief, slight burning feeling orblurry visionwhen you use them. Do not use any eyedrops without asking your doctor about them. Your eyes will probably heal very quickly. Most patients notice better vision within a few days. Call your doctor if you have any problems or unusual side effects. Don’t swim or use a hot tub for surgery. You might get a plastic shield to protect your eyes while you’re sleeping for a few days. Your doctor will tell you when to come back for follow-up visits. The first one will probably be a day or so after the procedure. Your vision can still change after LASIK. You might have to use reading glasses as you get older. More than 10% of people need a second LASIK procedure some time later to restore the effects. But overall, 90% of patients have vision that’s between 20// surgery.

What are Aberrations of the Eye?,"Described as small optical irregularities, aberrations are imperfections of the eye that result in light being unable to focus onto the retina effectively as well as defects in visual image. There are two types of aberrations; lower-order aberrations (0, 1st and 2nd order), and higher-order aberrations (3rd,4th…). Higher order aberrations (HOAs) of the eye are unable to be corrected by cylinder or spherical corrections and include spherical aberrations, coma and trefoil. Coma aberrations are caused when light rays from one edge of the pupil focuses before those from the opposing edge. Visually those with this type of aberration may experience smearing of an image so that images may appear to have a tail like a comet. Classed as a third order aberration, trefoil has a more minor affect on image quality compared to an equal amount of coma. Spherical aberrations can cause halos surrounding point light sources and a reduction in contrast sensitivity. It is thought that HOAs are responsible for individuals reporting complaints of glare, halos and reduction in contrast sensitivity following corneal refractive surgery. Approximately 90% of aberrations are caused by the cornea. The eyes of young people tend to be less affected by higher order aberrations due to the partial compensation of aberration between the surface of the cornea and the internal optics. This mechanism has been found to work systematically for spherical aberrations and horizontal comas. As they are only affected by a small number of spherical aberrations and comas, young eyes are thought to approximate to an aplanatic optical system. However, as we age, more aberrations occur on average, specifically spherical aberrations as well as horizontal comas. Lower order aberrations include astigmatism, positive defocus (myopia), and negative defocus (hyperopia). Those with astigmatism have an eye that is shaped like a rugby ball than rather football."
What are Aberrations of the Eye?,The human eye can be affected by a number of aberrations which can reduce the quality of retinal images and general visual perception. has shown that age increases the probability of developing higher order aberrations in particular.
What are Cataracts?,"Cataracts are whitish or cloudy patches that develop in a person’s eye lens and lead to blurred or clouded vision. Cataracts are the most common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Cataracts can develop in one or both eyes and interrupt the flow of light through the lens. The lens is usually transparent, allowing light to pass though to the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts, however, cause the lens to become opaque and as the cataracts grow in size or number, vision gradually worsens, as less light is able to penetrate the lens. The eye is composed of the following structures: Eyeball: This is filled with a jelly like material called the vitreous humour Conjunctiva: The thin lining covering the sclera (white of the eye) Cornea: The clear, transparent layer over the pupil that lets in light Lens: The transparent structure at the front of the eye through which light passes Retina: A thin nerve membrane located behind the lens that detects light passing into the eye. Nerves in the retina send signals to the brain via the optic nerve to create an image. Optic nerve: This carries the information from the retina to the brain so information can be interpreted into vision Sclera: The tough covering of the eyeball or the white of the eye Uvea: This is the vascular middle layer of the eye ball made up of the iris, the ciliary body and the chorid Orbit: This is the cavity that houses the eyeball One of the earliest symptoms of cataracts is blurred vision. The cloudier the lens becomes, the more sight is impaired, until vision in the affected eye is lost altogether. There is usually no pain associated with the condition. Cataracts usually affect the elderly but children and infants may also be affected."

What are cataracts?,"A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye(theclear part of the eye that helps to focus light). Cataracts are very common as you get older.In fact, more than half of all Americans age either have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of cataracts. At first, you may not notice that you have a cataract. But over time, cataracts can make your vision blurry, hazy, or less colorful. You may have trouble reading or doing other everyday activities. Over time, cataracts can lead to vision loss. The good news is that surgery can get rid of cataracts. Cataract surgery is safe and corrects vision problems caused by cataracts."
What are floaters?,"Floaters are small dark shapes that float across your vision. They can look like spots, threads, squiggly lines, or even little cobwebs. Most people have floaters that come and go, and they often don’t need treatment. But sometimes floaters can be a sign of a more serious eye condition. So if you notice new floaters that appear suddenly and don’t go away, it’s important to tell your eye doctor."
What are the Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma actually refers to a group of disorders. Open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma are the two major types of glaucoma. Both the types are characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), or pressure inside the eye."
What are the main types of corneal conditions?,"There are several common conditions that affect thecornea. Injuries. Small abrasions (scratches) on the cornea usually heal on their own. Deeper scratches or other injuries can cause corneal scarring and vision problems. Allergies. Allergies to pollen can irritate the eyes and cause allergic conjunctivitis (pink eye). This can make your eyes red, itchy, and watery. Keratitis. Keratitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the cornea. Infections related to contact lenses are the most common cause of keratitis. Dry eye. Dry eye happens when your eyes don’t make enough tears to stay wet. This can be uncomfortable and may cause vision problems. Corneal dystrophies. Corneal dystrophies cause cloudy vision when material builds up on the cornea. These diseases usually run in families. There are also a number of less common diseases that can affect the cornea — including ocular herpes, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, and pterygium. Go to the eye doctor or the emergency room if you have: Intense eye pain Change in vision Blurry vision Very red, watery eyes An object stuck in your eye A serious eye injury or trauma — like getting hit hard in the eye."
What are the risk factors for normal tension glaucoma?,"Some factors that predispose persons to increased risk of developing NTG are Family history of NTG - The TANK-binding kinase been found to be associated with NTG development. Japanese ancestry –The condition occurs most commonly among Japanese persons. Persons with a history of heart disease such as irregular heart rhythm, vascular dysfunction and ischemia. Female patients – The condition is more prevalent in females than male. Persons with hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance."
What are the risk factors for the development of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"OAG is most common in individuals who have a previous history of elevated IOP. African-Americans, elderly persons, and those with a family history of glaucoma are more at risk. Smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, anxiety, stress, and sleep apnea may also increase the risk of OAG. Elevated IOP is the most readily treatable risk factor."
What are the risks of having cataract surgery?,"Problems with cataract surgery are uncommon. Some people have bleeding, an infection or damage to their eye. If you notice any of the following, contact your eye specialist or go to the emergency department: your eye becoming red and painful fluid coming from your eye your sight getting worse."
What are the screening options for Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"In asymptomatic patients younger than 40 years, screening is recommended every three to five years. However, in African Americans, persons older than 40 years, and those with multiple risk factors, screening is recommended more frequently. Screening usually includes a complete medical history, eye examination using a gonioscope, binocular views of the optic discs, and a quantitative visual field test."
What are the side effects of eye dilation drops?,"Dilation is harmless in the long term, but it does come with short-term side effects. These will usually last for about four to six hours. Side effects of dilation include: light sensitivity blurry vision trouble focusing on close objects stinging right after the drops are put in If you wear contact lenses, you may not be able to wear them until the dilation drops wear off."
What are the signs and symptoms of traumatic glaucoma?,"Aching pain in the eye – This may occur immediately after the injury Light sensitivity Blurred vision Blood collection (hyphema) and inflammation in the eye Elevated eye pressure –due to the blockage of the eye canals with blood and inflammatory cells Pain may subside after the resolution of hyphema and inflammation, but the eye pressure may remain elevated. Although painless, increased IOP can cause significant damage to the optic nerve. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a long time until the visual loss has progressed to an advanced stage."
What are the stages of ROP?,"There are of ROP. Doctors use these stages to keep track of how serious ROP is. The stages range from stage 1 (mild) to stage 5 (severe): Stages — Babies in these stages usually get better without treatment and go on to have healthy vision. Doctors will watch babies carefully to see if their ROP gets worse. Stage 3— Some babies who develop stage with no treatment and go on to have healthy vision. But others need treatment to stop abnormal blood vessels from damaging the retina and causing retinal detachment (an eye problem that can cause vision loss). Stage 4— Babies in stage detached retinas and need treatment. Stage 5— In stage 5, the retina detaches completely. Even with treatment, babies in stage vision loss or blindness. Both stages are very serious. Babies in these stages often need surgery — but even with treatment, they may have vision loss. That’s why doctors usually start treatment in stage 3. It’s also possible for babies in any stage to get worse quickly and need treatment. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your baby gets their follow-up exams on schedule. Finding and treating ROP early is the best way to lower the chances it will cause serious problems."
What are the symptoms of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"The condition is asymptomatic in the initial stages, and patients do not present with any complaints until late in the course of the disease. Vision loss from this type begins peripherally and gradually moves to the center. Due to the silent and progressive nature of OAG, clinical evaluation is warranted in individuals at high risk."
What are the symptoms of ROP?,"There are no signs of ROP that you can see. In advanced cases of ROP, the retina may partially or completely pull away from its normal position at the back of the eye. This is called retinal detachment — and it can cause vision loss and blindness. If your baby had ROP that caused damage, you may later notice that: Their eyes wander, shake, or make other unusual movements Their eyes don’t follow objects Their pupils look white They have trouble recognizing faces Babies who had ROP are also more likely to have other eye problems as they get older, including: Retinal detachment Nearsightedness Amblyopia (lazy eye) Crossed eyes If your child had ROP when they were younger, it’s important to make sure they get regular checkups and eye exams. Finding and treating eye problems early will help protect your child’s vision as they get older."
What are the symptoms of amblyopia?,"Symptoms of amblyopia can be hard to notice. Kids with amblyopia may have poor depth perception — they have trouble telling how near or far something is. Parents may also notice signs that their child is struggling to see clearly, like: Squinting Shutting 1 eye Tilting their head In many cases, parents don’t know their child has amblyopia until a doctor diagnoses it during an eye exam. That’s why it’s important for all kids to get a vision screening at least once between ages ."
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"Symptoms of astigmatism may include: difficulty focusing blurred vision, both close up (long-sightedness or hyperopia) or far away (short-sightedness or myopia) headaches eyestrain and squinting difficulty seeing at night — you may see halos (spots of light) or glares fatigue ‘lazy eye’in children CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help."
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"The most common symptoms of astigmatism are: Blurry vision Needing to squint to see clearly Headaches Eye strain Trouble seeing at night If you have mild astigmatism, you might not notice any symptoms. That’s why it’s important to get regular eye exams — your eye doctor can help you make sure you’re seeing as clearly as possible. This is especially true for children, who may be less likely to realize that their vision isn’t normal."
What are the symptoms of cataracts?,"You might not have any symptoms at first, when cataracts are mild. But as they grow, cataracts can cause changes in your vision. For example, you may notice that: Your vision is cloudy or blurry Colors look faded You can’t see well at night Lamps, sunlight, or headlights seem too bright You see a halo around lights You see double (this sometimes goes away as the cataract gets bigger) You have to change the prescription for your glasses or contact lenses often Talk with your eye doctor if you have any of these symptoms — they could also be signs of other eye problems."
What are the symptoms of color vision deficiency?,"The main symptom of color vision deficiency is not seeing colors the way most people do. If you have color vision deficiency, you may have trouble seeing: The difference between colors How bright colors are Different shades of colors Symptoms of color vision deficiency are often so mild that they’re hard to notice. That’s why many people with color vision deficiency don’t know they have it. And people usually adjust to differences in how they see color. People with very serious cases of color vision deficiency might have other symptoms, too — like quick side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) or sensitivity to light."
What are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?,"In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilatedeye examsare so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy. You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could mean an emergency. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters) Flashes of light A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain Vision loss Eye pain or redness Talk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go: Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision Blurry or wavy vision Vision that changes a lot Trouble seeing colors."
What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?,"The early stages of diabetic retinopathy usually don’t have any symptoms. Some people notice changes in their vision, like trouble reading or seeing faraway objects. These changes may come and go. In later stages of the disease, blood vessels in the retina start to bleed into the vitreous (gel-like fluid that fills your eye). If this happens, you may see dark, floating spots or streaks that look like cobwebs. Sometimes, the spots clear up on their own — but it’s important to get treatment right away. Without treatment, scars can form in the back of the eye. Blood vessels may also start to bleed again, or the bleeding may get worse."
What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?,"You might not notice any symptoms in the early stages. Therefore, it is important to get youreyes checked regularlyby an optometrist if you have diabetes. If you have diabetic retinopathy, you might: find that your vision fluctuates (gets better and worse) have blurred or distorted vision have patchy vision that can’t be corrected with prescription glasses become sensitive to light or glare haveeye floaters(moving specks) in your vision find it more difficult to read, watch television or drive."
What are the symptoms of dry eye?,"Dry eye can cause: A scratchy feeling, like there’s something in your eye Stinging or burning feelings in your eye Red eyes Sensitivity to light Blurry vision."
What are the symptoms of eye cancer?,"Many people with eye cancer do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may find the condition when you have a routineeye test.If you do have symptoms, you may notice: blurred visionin one eye loss of peripheral vision dark spots on the white or coloured part (iris) of the eye small specks or wavy lines in your vision a change in the shape of the black part of the eye (the pupil) All of these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. But if you are worried, talk to your doctor."
What are the symptoms of floaters?,"Floaters move as your eyes move — so when you try to look at them directly, they seem to move away. When your eyes stop moving, floaters keep drifting across your vision. You may notice floaters more when you look at something bright, like white paper or a blue sky."
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"At first, glaucoma doesn’t usually have any symptoms. That’s why half of people with glaucoma don’t even know they have it. Over time, you may slowly lose vision, usually starting with your side (peripheral) vision — especially the part of your vision that’s closest to your nose. Because it happens so slowly, many people can’t tell that their vision is changing at first. But as the disease gets worse, you may start to notice that you can’t see things off to the side anymore. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually cause blindness."
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"Most people with glaucoma have few or no symptoms until their eyesight is damaged. If you haveprimary open angle glaucomayou may have no symptoms, or you may lose peripheral vision at first. You might not notice this until there is significant optic nerve damage. If you havechronic angle-closure glaucomayou sometimes get vision problems, such as a halo-like image around lights or you may have no symptoms. If you haveacute angle-closure glaucomayou may get sudden, severe eye pain with nausea and vomiting, headache, watery eyes,blurred vision, and halos around bright lights. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency, and you should seek treatment straight away so you don’t lose vision. Go to your nearestemergency departmentor call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance. CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help."
What are the symptoms of pink eye?,"The most common symptoms of pink eye are: Pink or red eyes Itchy or burning eyes Watery eyes White, yellow, or green fluid (discharge) coming from your eyes Crust along your eyelids or eyelashes, which may keep your eyes from opening when you wake up Pink eye may also cause: Swollen eyelids A feeling like something’s stuck in your eye Sensitivity to bright light Blurry vision A lump in front of your ear If you wear contact lenses, you may notice that they feel uncomfortable or don’t stay in place."
What are the symptoms of presbyopia?,"Symptoms of presbyopia include: Trouble seeing things up close Needing to hold reading materials farther away to focus on them Eye strain (when your eyes feel tired or sore) Headache Presbyopia gets worse over time, but it usually stops getting worse after age 65."
What are the symptoms of retinal detachment?,"If only a small part of your retina has detached, you may not have any symptoms. But if more of your retina is detached, you may not be able to see as clearly as normal, and you may notice other sudden symptoms, including: A lot of new floaters (small dark spots or squiggly lines that float across your vision) Flashes of light in one eye or both eyes A dark shadow or “curtain” on the sides or in the middle of your field of vision Retinal detachment is a medical emergency.If you have symptoms of a detached retina, it’s important to go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away. The symptoms of retinal detachment often come on quickly. If the retinal detachment isn’t treated right away, more of the retina can detach — which increases the risk of permanent vision loss or blindness."
What are the symptoms of uveitis?,"There are different kinds of uveitis associated with JIA. The most common form of uveitis has no symptoms (‘silent uveitis’), which is why regular eye check ups are essential. However your child may complain of blurring of vision, sensitivity to light, and, rarely, eye redness or pain. If left untreated, uveitis can result in loss of vision."
What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?,"Treatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include: Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye But these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep yourblood pressureandcholesterolin a healthy range.

What are the types of cataracts?,"Most cataracts arerelatedto age— they happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. But you can get cataracts for other reasons —likeafter an eye injury or after surgery for another eye problem (likeglaucoma). No matter what type of cataract you have,you’ll need surgery to treatit."
What are the types of color vision deficiency?,"The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green. Another type makes blue and yellow look the same. In rare cases, people have complete color vision deficiency, which means they don’t see color at all."
What are the types of eye cancer?,"If the cancer starts to grow in the eye itself, it is called a primary cancer. If the cancer spreads to the eye (metastasises) from another body part, such as thebreastorlungsit is called a secondary cancer. There are a few different types of primary eye cancer. The most common form of primary eye cancer in adults is melanoma. It is quite different to themelanomayou get on your skin as it can start in a part of the body that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Eye melanoma, also called 'ocular melanoma' or 'uveal melanoma', grows in the cells of the eye that produce melanin (the pigment that gives your skin its colour). It affects the middle of the three layers of the wall of the eye which contains a few separate parts. It can affect any of the parts in this layer. You can't see ocular melanoma by looking in a mirror. Another type of rare eye cancer islymphoma, which affects yourimmune systemand usually starts in your glands (lymph nodes). Retinoblastoma is a cancer which grows in the cells of the retina (the part of the back of the eye that senses light). It can grow in one or both eyes and occur at any age, but usually in children under age."
What are the types of glaucoma?,"There are many different types of glaucoma, but the most common type in the United States is calledopen-angle glaucoma— that’s what most people mean when they talk about glaucoma. Other types are less common, like angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma."
What are the types of glaucoma?,"There are several different types of glaucoma. The of glaucoma are: open-angle — where fluid pressure builds up in the front part of the eye even when the fluid drainage pathways are open closed-angle (or angle-closure) — where the eye’s fluid drainage pathways are narrowed or closed, so fluid pressure builds up quickly, which may cause pain in the eye and sudden loss of vision Different types of open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma can be categorised as either: primary glaucoma — with an unknown cause; or secondary glaucoma — caused by an eye condition, such as surgery, trauma, drugs or eye disease Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma in Australia."
What are the types of low vision?,The type of low vision that you have depends on the disease or condition that caused your low vision. The most common types of low vision are: Central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision) Central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision) Peripheral vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes) Peripheral vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes) Night blindness (not being able to see in low light) Night blindness (not being able to see in low light) Blurry or hazy vision Blurry or hazy vision.
What can I do to prevent diabetic retinopathy?,"Managing your diabetes is the best way to lower your risk of diabetic retinopathy. That means keeping your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. You can do this by getting regular physical activity, eating healthy, and carefully following yourdoctor’sinstructions for your insulin or other diabetes medicines. To make sure your diabetes treatment plan is working, you’ll need a special lab test called an A1C test. This test shows your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months. You can work with your doctor to set a personal A1C goal. Meeting your A1C goal can help prevent or manage diabetic retinopathy. Having high blood pressure or high cholesterol along with diabetes increases your risk for diabetic retinopathy. So controlling your blood pressure and cholesterol can also help lower your risk for visionloss."
What causes ROP?,"Normally, the blood vessels of the retina start to develop in the fourth month of pregnancy and finish developing around the due date, or pregnancy. If a baby is born very early, these blood vessels may stop developing normally. The retina then develops new blood vessels that are abnormal. This is called retinal neovascularization, or NV. These abnormal blood vessels can grow in the wrong direction. The blood vessels are attached to the retina — so if they grow too far in the wrong direction, they can pull the retina up off the back of the eye. This is a type of retinal detachment."
What causes amblyopia?,"In many cases, doctors don’t know the cause of amblyopia. But sometimes, a different vision problem can lead to amblyopia. Normally, the brain uses nerve signals from both eyes to see. But if an eye condition makes vision in , the brain may try to work around it. It starts to “turn off” signals from the weaker eye and rely only on the stronger eye. Some eye conditions that can lead to amblyopia are: Refractive errors.These include common vision problems like nearsightedness (having trouble seeing far away), farsightedness (having trouble seeing things up close), and astigmatism (which can cause blurry vision). Normally, these problems are easy to fix with glasses or contacts. But if they’re not treated, the brain may start to rely more on the eye with stronger vision. Strabismus. Usually, the eyes move together as a pair. But in kids with strabismus, the eyes don’t line up. One eye might drift in, out, up, or down. Cataract.This causes cloudiness in the lens of the eye, making things look blurry. While most cataracts happen in older people, babies and children can also develop cataracts."
What causes astigmatism?,"Astigmatism happens when your cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. The shape makes light bend differently as it enters your eye, causing a refractive error. Doctors don’t know what causes astigmatism, and there’s no way to prevent it. Some people are born with astigmatism, but many people develop it as children or young adults. Some people may also develop astigmatism after an eye injury or an eye surgery."
What causes astigmatism?,"There are several potential causes of astigmatism, including: inherited orcongenitalcauses (being born with astigmatism) eye injury a complication following eye surgery ageing other eye conditions such askeratoconus."
What causes cataracts?,"Most cataracts happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. When you’re young, the lens in your eye is clear. Around age 40, the proteins in the lens of your eye start to break down and clump together. This clump makes a cloudy area on your lens — known as a cataract. Over time, the cataract gets worse and makes more of your lens cloudy."
What causes color vision deficiency?,"Most people who have color vision deficiency are born with it. This is because the most common types of color vision deficiency are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parents. Color vision deficiency can also happen because of an injury to the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye), the optic nerve (which connects the eye to the brain), or the brain itself.Some examples of injuries that can lead to color vision deficiency are: Retinal detachment(when the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of the eye) Eye injuries caused by lasers Some kinds of brain tumors — especially ones that affect the optic nerve or put pressure on the brain Radiation treatments Color vision may also get worse as you get older — often because ofcataracts(cloudy areas in the lens of the eye)."
What causes crossed eyes?,"Crossed eyes occur either due to nerve damage or when the muscles around your eyes don’t work together because some are weaker than others. When your brain receives a different visual message from each eye, it ignores the signals coming from your weaker eye. If your condition isn’t corrected, you may lose vision in your weaker eye. Crossed eyes are common in children. Often the underlying cause is unknown. Infantile esotropia is a type of crossed eyes that appears in babies during their first year of life. Esotropia runs in families and usually requires surgery to correct. Acquired esotropia occurs in children usuallybetween the ages of . Eyeglasses can usually correct it. Crossed eyes can also occur later in life. It’s usually caused by physical disorders, like eye injuries, cerebral palsy, or stroke. You may also develop crossed eyes if you have alazy eyeor arefarsighted."
What causes diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is acomplication of diabetes. Diabetes can cause the tiny blood vessels in the back of your eye to swell and bleed. This process can slowly damage your retina. Usually, both eyes are affected. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely it is that you will get diabetic retinopathy. Your chance of getting diabetic retinopathy also increases if: your diabetes and blood sugar levels are not well controlled you havehigh blood pressure you havehigh cholesterol."
What causes diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar due to diabetes. Over time, having too much sugar in your blood can damage your retina — the part of your eye that detects light and sends signals to your brain through a nerve in the back of your eye (optic nerve). Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The damage to your eyes starts when the sugar in your blood causes changes to the tiny blood vessels that go to your retina. These changes make it harder for the blood to flow, leading to blocked blood vessels that leak fluid or bleed. To make up for these blocked blood vessels, your eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. These new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily."
What causes dry eye?,"Normally, glands above your eyes make tears that keep your eyes wet. Dry eye happens when your tears don’t do their job. This could mean: Your glands don’t make enough tears to keep your eyes wet Your tears dry up too fast Your tears just don’t work well enough to keep your eyes wet."
What causes eye cancer?,"Doctors don't fully understand why eye cancer develops, but there are some factors that increase your risk of eye melanoma, including: having light-coloured eyes having pale skin growing older having a lot of moles on your skin having a close relative who has had eye cancer UV radiation from sunlight (or sunlamps) may also increase your risk for melanoma of the eye."
What causes floaters?,"Floaters usually happen because of normal changes in your eyes. As you age, tiny strands of your vitreous (the gel-like fluid that fills your eye) stick together and cast shadows on your retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). Those shadows appear as floaters. Sometimes floaters have more serious causes, including: Eye infections Eye injuries Uveitis(inflammation in the eye) Bleeding in the eye Vitreous detachment(when the vitreous pulls away from the retina) Retinal tear (when vitreous detachment tears a hole in the retina) Retinal detachment(when the retina gets pulled away from the back of the eye) Sometimes new floaters can be a sign of a retinal tear or retinal detachment — when the retina gets torn or pulled from its normal position at the back of the eye. Symptoms can include: A lot of new floaters that appear suddenly, sometimes with flashes of light A dark shadow (like a curtain) or blurry area in your side or central vision Retinal tear or detachment can be a medical emergency. If you have these symptoms, it’s important to go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away."
What causes glaucoma?,"Doctors don’t clearly understand why glaucoma happens. Glaucoma refers to a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve that links theeyeto the brain. The optic nerve carries signals from the back of your eye to the brain and allows you to see. Nerve damage can result from problems with the fluid in the eye. Sometimes, the pressure of the fluid inside the eye rises, and the fluid presses hard on the optic nerve, damaging it. Glaucoma can sometimes occur even when the fluid pressure in the eye is normal."
What causes glaucoma?,"Scientists aren’t sure what causes the most common types of glaucoma, but many people with glaucoma have high eye pressure — and treatments that lower eye pressure help to slow the disease. There’s no way to prevent glaucoma. That’s why eye exams are so important — so you and your doctor can find it before it affects your vision."
What causes low vision?,"Many different eye conditions can cause low vision, but the most common causes are: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Cataracts Cataracts Diabetic retinopathy(a condition that can cause vision loss in people with diabetes) Diabetic retinopathy(a condition that can cause vision loss in people with diabetes) Glaucoma Glaucoma Low vision is more common in older adults because many of the diseases that can cause it are more common in older adults. Aging doesn’t cause low vision on its own. Eye and brain injuries and certain genetic disorders can also cause low vision."
What causes pink eye?,"Most of the time, pink eye is caused by a virus or bacteria. Viral pink eye is the most common type. You can also get pink eye from allergies to things like pollen or pet fur — or from other things that can bother your eyes, like pool water with chlorine, air pollution, or makeup. It can be hard to figure out the exact cause of pink eye, because the symptoms are usually the same."
What causes presbyopia?,"As you age, the lens in your eye gets harder and less flexible, and it stops focusing light correctly on the retina. This makes nearby objects look blurry. Presbyopia is different than farsightedness — another refractive error that makes it hard to see things up close.Learn more about farsightedness."
What causes retinal detachment?,"There are many causes of retinal detachment, but the most common causes are aging or an eye injury. There are retinal detachment: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative. Each type happens because of a different problem that causes your retina to move away from the back of your eye."
What causes traumatic glaucoma?,"Elevated IOP following trauma results from a multitude of factors. Drainage impairment may occur at the trabecular meshwork due to injury and hyphema, a pooling of blood inside the anterior chamber of the eye. Injury and inflammation to the lens or iris can also lead to the development of traumatic glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) may also develop. These adhesions between the peripheral iris and the angular structures of the anterior chamber reduce outflow of aqueous humor (eye fluid), resulting in increased intraocular pressure."
What causes uveitis in JIA?,"The immune system, which usually fights infections, attacks the inner part of the eye. No one knows why this occurs in JIA patients."
What causes vision loss for people over ?,"The major eye diseases among people older are diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The number of people with blindness and vision loss increases with age in all racial and ethnic groups."
What causes your eye to hurt when you blink?,"Common causes for eye pain when you blink include dry eyes, a stye, or pink eye (conjunctivitis). More serious conditions that can cause your eye to hurt when you blink include glaucoma or optic neuritis. You should see your doctor if symptoms don’t ease within at-home remedies aren’t effective and the pain gets worse. If the condition is more serious than a simple infection or irritation of your eye, you will need medical attention quickly. Pain when blinking is often only one symptom of a problem. Others may appear, too. If your eye pain isn’t caused by an obvious injury or condition, other symptoms can help you and your doctor understand what is causing the pain. These symptoms include: pain when moving your eyes pressure in your eyes inflammation of your eyelid or eyelash follicles pain or sensitivity when exposed to light tenderness around your eyes (the sinuses) If you experience the following symptoms when you blink, you should seek emergency medical treatment: unbearable pain impaired vision severe pain when touching your eye vomiting or abdominal pain appearance of halos around lights difficulty closing your eyelids entirely because your eye is bulging outward If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, or if the pain and symptoms remain after you gently flush your eyes with water or saline, call an emergency room right away. Learn more: First aid for eye injuries » Eye pain when you blink isn’t always a sign of a bigger problem. It can be irritating but isn’t always dangerous. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take treatment seriously. If you don’t get treatment for any underlying infections, injuries, or inflammation, your symptoms could last longer than necessary. The symptoms may grow more severe, too. This can lead to additional complications. Complications of not treating an eye issue."
What does an ophthalmologist do?,"Ophthalmologists are surgeons, and can do: cataract surgery, in which they replace the lens in your eye refractive or laser surgery, which involves reshaping your cornea to correctshort-sightedness,long-sightednessorastigmatism surgery to correct misalignment of your eyes, orstrabismus surgery to removecancers, such as melanoma, from the eye treatment to repair damage caused by an eye injury."
What does pink eye look like?,"Pink eye looks like the whites of one or both eyes are pink or red. You may have swelling around your eyes and could see white, yellow, or green discharge. Pink eye vs. stye Stye and pink eye are eye infections with similar symptoms. Like pink eye, symptoms of a stye include itchy, sore, and watery eyes and sensitivity to light. But unlike conjunctivitis, a stye causes a small pus-filled bump in the upper or lower eyelid. It also happens due to a bacterial infection, most commonlyStaphylococcus aureusandStaphylococcus epidermidis."
What eye problems can diabetes cause?,"Over time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which canharm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss andretinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage theoptic nerve(the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye. Cataract, which happen when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. ers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes."

What happens during LASIK?,"You’re given drops to numb your eye tissues. A small flap is cut into the epithelium using a tool called a femtosecond laser. This allows your surgeon to move this layer to the side while the other layers are reshaped with lasers. Because it remains attached, the epithelium can be put back in its place after the surgery’s done, rather than being fully removed as it is in PRK. An excimer laser is used to reshape corneal tissues and fix any issues with eye curvature. The flap in the epithelium is put back in its place over the rest of the cornea tissue to let it heal with the rest of the tissues."
What happens during cataract surgery?,"On the day of the surgery, you will be given eye drops that include anantibiotic. You might be given an injection around your eye or eye drops to make the eye go numb. Most people have alocal anaesthetic and light sedation. During the procedure you will be asked to lie on your back. The doctor will make a small cut in your eye. This lets them remove your cloudy lens and insert the plastic lens. The operation usually takes less than 30 minutes. There will always be medical staff to talk to during the procedure. If you have any problems, you should tell one of the staff. Watch this animated video on how cataract surgery is done: Your doctor will place a pad over your eye that was operated on. You will also be given eye drops to use at home. Make sure you understand how to use them and how long you need to use them for. You might have some pain or discomfort in that eye. Tell a nurse or doctor so they can give you some pain relief medicine. Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure and does not require an overnight stay in hospital. You will need someone to take you home after cataract surgery. You should not drive until your vision has returned to normal. For a few weeks after the operation, you will need to avoid rubbing your eye. Ask your doctor when you can go back to your usual activities. If you have cataracts in both eyes, they will usually be treated on separate days — maybe weeks apart."
"What if I Can’t Keep my Eye Open During Surgery, or if I Move my Head?",We use a device to keep your eye open during the procedure. This device is a lid holder that gently holds your lids open during the procedure. Our physicians will make sure you are positioned correctly. The laser also tracks your eye throughout the procedure to adjust to your movements.

What is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"& DNV GL Surprise Rights Drive, 84132."
What is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of long-standing diabetes that affects vision. It describes damage to the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for transmitting nerve impulses to the visual centres in the brain via the optic nerve. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a persistenthigh blood sugarlevel. This can eventually damage the small blood vessels that supply the retina with nutrients and oxygen. The retina is then starved of vital nutrients as well as being potentially exposed to leakage from the damaged blood vessels which can blur vision. Without treatment, diabetic retinopathy can lead to a complete loss of vision. The retina lies at the back of the eye and is provided with a supply of blood vessels and nerves. In the initial stages of diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels that supply the retina develop tiny swellings called microaneurysms which are prone to hemorrahge. In addition, the interruption to the supply of nutrients and oxygen triggers the formation of new blood vessels across the eye. However, these new blood vessels are brittle and also prone to breakage. Both the microaneurysms and the new blood vessels may rupture causing the leakage of blood into the retina and blurred vision. Eventually, new blood vessels, aneurysms and scarring may occur all over the retina, including the central part of the retina called the macula which is responsible for central vision. This can cause a reduction in eye sight or in more advanced cases, a complete loss of vision. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and the condition may go unnoticed. If symptoms are present, they may include: Intermittent fasting outperforms traditional drugs in managing early type 2 diabetes Oral semaglutide proves effective for type weight loss in Dutch study WHO issues."
What is Eye Cancer?,"Any cancer that starts in or around the eye is called eye cancer. Cancer starts when cells mutate. Ocular oncologists specialize in treating eye cancer. Different types of cancer start in different parts of the eye. Your eye has three main parts: the eyeball; the orbit, tissues surrounding the eye; and structures such as the eyelids and tear glands. Here are some examples of eye cancers: Intraocular cancers:Uveal melanomaLymphoma Uveal melanoma Lymphoma Retinoblastoma, the most common eye cancer in children Cancers on the surface of the eye Metastatic cancers Benign tumors Blurry vision or sudden loss of vision Floaters in your eye (spots or squiggles that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light A growing dark spot on your iris, the colored part of the eye Pupil changes in size or shape Eyeball changes position within its socket Bulging eyeballs These symptoms may not be due to cancer. They could be from a different condition. A physician can evaluate these symptoms. Patients with eye cancer rarely feel pain, unless the tumor has grown outside the eyeball. There is no exact cause, but certain types of characteristics have been linked with eye cancer.

What is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common ocular condition whereby damage is caused to the optic nerve connecting the eye to the brain. Image Credit: Olena Yakobchuk/Shutterstock.com It is considered to be the second greatest factor causing permanent blindness in the US and typically affects aging adults. Generally, glaucoma is referred to as an acquired loss of axons of the optic nerve and ganglion cells of the retina or optic neuropathy which leads to progressive vision loss. The condition can affect both eyes, yet, progression may differ between each eye, meaning glaucoma may be worse in one eye. One of the main features of glaucoma is high intraocular pressure. The eye’s anterior chamber which hosts the cornea, iris, lens, and pupil is filled by aqueous humor a clear, water-like fluid. This fluid helps nourish the lens and cornea by supplying them with vital nutrients and oxygen. Other functions include providing the necessary pressure to maintain the eye’s shape, referred to as intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma typically develops as a result of a blockage in the eye’s drainage tubes called the trabecular meshwork. Due to the blockage, the aqueous humor is unable to flow, causing pressure to build up in the eye. This increased pressure subsequently damages the optic nerve and the retina’s nerve fibers. The most commonly diagnosed type in the UK and US is primary open-angle glaucoma."
What is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is among the leading cause of permanent vision loss in most regions of the world. Damage to the optic nerve fibers resulting from glaucoma causes optic nerve cupping, which results in loss of vision and in some cases requires the removal of the eye. Glaucoma is the term for a group of conditions that cause the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells within the retina. Glaucoma affects over globally, making it the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Glaucoma often does not produce any symptoms until it has become severe. Surveys show that only about 10% to 50% of individuals with glaucoma actually realize they have it. Glaucoma is classified into two main categories, open-angle glaucoma, and angle-closure glaucoma, both of which cause primary glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form, but angle-closure glaucoma is responsible for more cases of very severe vision loss. Secondary glaucoma can result from trauma, inflammation, tumors, medications (e.g. corticosteroids), and certain conditions (e.g. pigment dispersion). Many studies have discovered an increased risk of developing glaucoma with a higher cup-disk ratio (CDR), CDR asymmetry, hemorrhaging of the disc, or increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The risk of developing glaucoma is also increased in older individuals or those who have a family history of the disease. Glaucoma is diagnosed on the basis of different tests. One test involves placing a simple mirrored instrument on the patient’s eye which allows for the examination of the angle using a biomicroscope. This technique is referred to as gonioscopy. Unfortunately, it is a very subjective method of assessment with poor reproducibility as the results may be affected by variations in the light levels and in the force of eye compression. Imaging can be used to assess the eye for angle closure. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can provide real-time images."
What is LASIK?,"LASIK is a surgical procedure where the cornea of the eye is reshaped in order to reduce a person’s dependency on glasses or contact lenses. The acronym LASIK stands forLaserInSituKeratomileusis because an excimer laser (a type of ultraviolet laser) is used. It is similar to other corrective procedures such as photorefractive keratectomy but provides several additional benefits – primarily a quicker recovery period. Image Credit: BLACKDAY/Shutterstock.com Like any other procedure, the results of LASIK surgery are determined on the basis of certain parameters that includeefficacy, predictability, stability, safety and patient satisfaction. It is crucial that the surgeon evaluates the patient’s expectations of LASIK surgery and make sure that they are realistic. The LASIK procedure involves increasing the eye’s intraocular pressure to at least a suction device. Then a mechanical microkeratome (a blade device) or a laser keratome (a laser device) is used to create a corneal flap at least diameter and . This flap is then folded back revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea, which is reshaped by the pulses from a computer-controlled excimer laser beam. The size of the optical zone and the depth of the laser ablation represent key determinants of the correction achieved. The amount of tissue the laser will remove is calculated ahead of time. Once the reshaping is finished, the surgeon replaces and secures the flap without the need for stitches. The cornea will hold the flap in place without any special intervention. Patients can have mild postoperative discomfort for up to LASIK treatment, during which time they should rest with their eyes closed. LASIK represents an outpatient procedure that takes only minutes per eye, thus it can be done on one or both eyes during the same session. Eye drops that numb the surface of the eye is used as the."

This form of glaucoma is commonly referred to as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). NTG is associated with glaucomatous optic nerve damage, progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fiber, and visual field defects."
What is Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is an irreversible optic neuropathy characterised by peripheral visual loss that usually precedes central vision loss. Due to its chronic nature and lack of early indicators of disease progression, OAG is a major health concern worldwide."
What is Retinal Detachment?,"The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts visual images into nerve impulses in the brain. Injuries to the eye can cause layers of the retina to separate, which is known as a retinal detachment. Any portion of the retina that is detached cannot send visual signals to the brain. If left untreated, retinal detachment can cause blindness. A retinal detachment is considered an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Anyone who has experienced trauma to the eye should see an ophthalmologist who can perform a dilated eye exam. Blunt eye trauma can cause bruises and scarring of the retina. Following a blunt trauma, tears can develop and lead to blinding retinal detachments at any time in life. Symptoms of retinal detachment include light flashes, floaters, and loss of vision. Both surgical and non-surgical procedures are used to treat retinal detachment. The best way to treat ocular trauma is to prevent it in the first place by wearing protective eyewear and avoiding hazardous conditions. Sports-related injuries, car accidents, fireworks, trampolines, and BB guns are some of the most common causes of eye injuries in children. Learn more about retinal detachment: National Eye Institute: Facts about retinal detachment Over the course of an individual’s lifetime, the vitreous inside of the eye shrinks. As it continues to shrink, a portion of retinal tissue may stay attached to the vitreous, leading to a retinal tear. If left untreated, a tear may lead to retinal detachment. With treatment, the damage usually can be repaired. As with retinal tears, the vitreous inside of the eye shrinks as we age. As it continues to shrink, a small portion of retinal tissue may be torn off of the retina, leading to a retinal hole. If left untreated, most retinal holes."
What is Traumatic Glaucoma?,"Among young people, ocular injuries are common and comprise an important cause of preventable visual morbidity. Although ocular trauma is common, many injuries are minor and do not require hospital admission. However, it should be noted that certain ocular injuries are serious and potentially fatal. Certain forms of ocular trauma can manifest later as secondary glaucoma, also known as traumatic glaucoma. Traumatic glaucoma is clinically defined as a post-traumatic rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) more than . Traumatic glaucoma can develop due to blunt trauma or injuries that bruise the eye; however, some forms are caused due to penetrating eye injuries. The development of the condition varies and may be acute or chronic in onset."
What is a comprehensive eye exam?,"Acomprehensive eye examconducted by a doctor of optometry determines the eye and vision health of a patient. During the exam, the doctor checks not only visual acuity through refraction but also the health of your eyes, eye tissue and other diseases. Each patient's symptoms, along with the doctor of optometry’s professional judgment, will determine what tests are conducted."
What is a doctor of optometry/optometrist?,"Doctors of optometry (O.D.s/optometrists), America’s primary eye health care providers, are the frontline of eye and vision care. Doctors of optometry are essential health care providers and are recognized as physicians under Medicare. They examine, diagnose, treat and manage diseases and disorders of the eye. In addition to providing eye and vision care, they play a major role in an individual’s overall health and well-being by detecting systemic diseases, and diagnosing, treating and managing ocular manifestations of those diseases, and providing vaccinations. Doctors of optometry: Prescribe medications, low vision rehabilitation, vision therapy, spectacle lenses, contact lenses and perform certain surgical procedures. Counsel patients regarding surgical and non-surgical options that meet their visual needs related to their occupations, avocations and lifestyle. Complete pre-professional undergraduate education in a college or university and four years of professional education at a college of optometry, leading to the doctor of optometry (O.D.) degree.

What is a retinal break?,"About 80% of the eye is filled with a gel-like vitreous body, which gives the eye its round contour. This is crisscrossed by millions of very fine connective tissue fibers, which are attached more or less loosely to the retinal surface. In most patients, the vitreous humor contracts with age. In areas where the fibers are firmly attached, the retina tears due to the pulling away of the vitreous. This creates a retinal hole. Thus, retinal breaks are holes in the retina that occur mostly when the vitreous body in front of the retina contracts and tugs on it. This leads to the seepage of fluid underneath the retina through the break. As a result, the retina in that area detaches from the underlying RPE. This is also called a rhegmatogenous retinal break and is seen in a quarter of patients who present with posterior vitreous detachment. This shoots up to two-thirds of the patient also has associated vitreous hemorrhage. Other reasons for a retinal break to occur include: Any condition which causes degeneration of the peripheral retina The trauma of the eye Surgery on the eye High myopia Macular pucker in rare cases Retinal breaks may be peripheral or macular. Flap tears, where a U-shaped or horseshoe tear occurs in the posterior part of the retina. This is the most likely to lead to fluid collection under the sensory layer and later to retinal detachment. Flap tears are often associated with local vitreous traction pulling up a flap of the retina. Atrophic holes, which are the most common types, are holes extending through the full thickness of the retina. These wholes are usually round, and the surrounding area may or may not be pigmented. Atrophic holes occur due to poor vascular supply and degenerative conditions of the retina, such."
What is amblyopia?,"Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor visionthat usually happens in just less commonly in both eyes. It develops when there’s a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and the brain can’t recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other, stronger eye — while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. It’s called “lazy eye” because the stronger eye worksbetter. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and they can’t control the way their eyes work. Amblyopia starts in childhood, and it’s the most common cause of vision loss in kids. Up to it. The good news is that early treatment works well and usually prevents long-term vision problems."
What is an ophthalmologist and what do they do?,"An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in surgical eye procedures. All ophthalmologists must complete a full medical program before they can begin a residency program in ophthalmology. An ophthalmology residency program takes an additional years to complete, depending on the school and curriculum. The residency program expands on: diagnosis and management of internal and external eye diseases training for eye disease subspecialties ophthalmic surgical training for all types of eye conditions Ophthalmology residency training also includes the hands-on care of patients, which involves performing surgical procedures under supervision. The residency program generally follows a one year internship. In2018, the average salary for ophthalmologists was $290, Salary.com. You can visit an ophthalmologist for the same care as an optometrist, such as a routine eye exam or prescription refill. However, an ophthalmologist can also perform eye surgery for various diseases and conditions, including cataracts,glaucoma, andstrabismussurgery, plus more. Ophthalmologists provide the following services: basic optometry services medical and surgical treatment of eye diseases rehabilitation services after eye surgery Ophthalmologists receive years of training in order to be able to perform in-depth surgical procedures for diseases of the eyes. Given that this is their specialty, almost all ophthalmologists will focus on this as their primary scope of care."
What is an ophthalmologist?,"Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with additional specialist training in the diagnosis and management of disorders of the eye and visual system. They are also sometimes called eye doctors or eye surgeons. In Australia, ophthalmologists need to complete at least specialist training after they become a doctor.

What is astigmatism?,Astigmatism is a common eye problem that can make your vision blurry or distorted. It happens when your cornea (the clear front layer of your eye) or lens (an inner part of your eye that helps the eye focus) has a different shape than normal. The only way to find out if you have astigmatism is to get an eye exam. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can help you see better — and some people can get surgery to fix their astigmatism.
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a commoneyecondition where the cornea or lens in your eye is not perfectly curved. Instead of being shaped like a soccer ball, it is curved like a rugby ball. This means that light entering the eye focuses at 2 places (rather than one) on the retina. This can make your vision mildly or severely blurry. Your ability to see both close up (long-sightedness) and far away (short-sightedness) are affected. There are astigmatism: regular —the cornea is curved more in one direction (e.g. vertically) than the other (e.g. horizontally) irregular —the curvature of the cornea is uneven across the surface of the eye."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error where the front surface of the eye (the cornea) or the lens inside the eye has an irregular curvature which causes the vision to be distorted and blurred. For example, instead of having a round, spherical curvature like a basketball, the cornea may be elongated like a rugby ball. Light rays entering an astigmatic eye are bent unevenly. As a result, these rays do not focus at a single point on the retina, causing some parts of the image to be more out of focus than others. There are a number of different types of astigmatism. These include: simple; compound; mixed; regular; irregular; corneal; and lenticular. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness (myopia) and far-sightedness (hypermetropia). The exact cause remains unknown; however, some common types of astigmatism seem to run in families and may be inherited. It is thought that most people have some form of astigmatism as it is rare to find perfectly shaped curves in the cornea and lens, but the defect is rarely serious. Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea is highly astigmatic and may cause severely distorted vision. Blurred or distorted vision, eye strain and headaches are possible symptoms of astigmatism. There are different amounts of blur in different directions. Perform an eye examination to determine whether you have astigmatism. Refer you to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for correction of the astigmatism with prescription glasses or contact lenses. Refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for laser eye surgery, lens surgery or corneal surgery, which can help correct certain types of astigmatism.

A cancer or tumor is basically an uncontrolled growth of any particular cell or group of cells. This tumor may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancerous tumors are fast growing, fast spreading and may be fatal if not treated. Eye cancers like other eye diseases are treated by Ophthalmologists and oncologists (cancer specialists). The normal eye has three basic parts (1, 2) – Associated structures of the eye. These include – The eyeball or the globe. It is filled with jelly like material called the vitreous humor.Conjunctiva – the thin transparent cover over the eyeThe sclera – the tough covering of the eyeball or the whites of the eyesThe uvea middle layer covering of the eye ball. It has three parts –The pupil and the iris that act as light aperturesThe ciliary body that regulates the papillary openingThe chorid that is pigmented and nourishes the retinaThe retina that forms the picture Cornea – the clear transparent layer over the pupil that lets in lightThe lens the crystalline non-cellular and hard organ that allows sightThe optic nerve that carries the information of the picture from the retina to the brain for sight.

What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common eye problem that causes vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve. If untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness. Usually the deterioration in vision is very gradual and not noticeable, so regulareye examinationsare recommended for people from middle age. Once detected, glaucoma can be treated to prevent or delay further vision damage."
What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. The symptoms can start so slowly that you may not notice them. The only way to find out if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam. There’s no cure for glaucoma, but early treatment can often stop the damage and protect your vision."
What is long-sightedness?,"Long-sightedness (also known as hyperopia) is a common eye condition that can be hard to detect. It makes close objects appear blurry, or you might be able to focus clearly but get tired eyes or headaches. For people with significant long-sightedness, vision can be blurry for things in the distance as well."
What is low vision?,"Low vision is a vision problem that makes it hard to do everyday activities. It can’t be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or other standard treatments like medicine or surgery. You may have low vision if you can’t see well enough to do things like: Read Read Drive Drive Recognize people’s faces Recognize people’s faces Tell colors apart Tell colors apart See your television or computer screen clearly See your television or computer screen clearly."
What is pink eye?,"Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, causes swelling and redness in the inside of your eyelid and the white part of your eye. Your eye may also feel itchy and painful. Pink eye is common, and some types of pink eye spread very easily. You can keep from spreading it to other people by washing your hands often and not sharing items like pillowcases, towels, or makeup. Some types of pink eye get better on their own. If your case is mild, you can ease your symptoms at home using a cold compress and eye drops you can get over the counter, meaning without a prescription. Other types of pink eye may need treatment from a doctor. Pink eye can cause serious health problems for newborn babies. Call a doctor now if your baby has: Unusual fluid (discharge) coming from the eye Puffy red eyelids."
What is presbyopia?,Presbyopia is a refractive error that makes it hard for middle-aged and older adults to see things up close. It happens because the lens (an inner part of the eye that helps the eye focus) stops focusing light correctly on the retina (a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). Presbyopia is a normal part of aging. Everyone gets presbyopia as they get older — usually after age 45. Many people have another refractive error in addition to presbyopia.
What is retinal detachment?,Retinal detachment is an eye problem that happens when your retina (a light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye) is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.
What is retinal detachment?,"Retinal detachment occurs when the retina, the light-sensitive nerve tissue lining the inside of the eye, becomes separated from where it is normally attached at the back of the eye. When this happens, the retina stops functioning, causing loss of vision. The retina is responsible for converting light into nerve impulses that are then sent along the optic nerve to the brain. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency. If not treated properly, it can lead to permanent blindness in the affected eye when the retina becomes permanently detached. Although retinal detachment is rare, affecting , year, the consequences can be catastrophic loss of sight, so if you have symptoms of retinal detachment, such as sudden onset of floaters or flashes, you should contact an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) or your doctor immediately. This could save your sight. Retinal detachment may start with tears or holes in the retina – if these aren’t treated they may lead to retinal detachment. Symptoms of retinal detachment may include: Sudden onset of, or a sudden increase in,‘floaters’(dark moving specks or ‘cobwebs’) andflashes(momentary flashes of light like a camera flash or lightning bolt) that appear in your vision. Sudden deterioration in, or loss of, vision. This is commonly described as a‘curtain’ or ‘shadow’appearing across the field of vision, often starting on one side and moving towards the centre. Blurred vision. Loss of peripheral vision(vision at the sides). If you havesuddenonset of these symptoms you should visit a doctor or an ophthalmologist immediately. Flashes and floaters also occur as normal age-related changes to the eye, and are present in two-thirds of over 70-year-olds. They are often associated with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a condition causing some tugging on the retina. PVD requires no treatment, but is associated with increased risk of retinal detachment. It can be hard."
What is short-sightedness?,"Short-sightedness (also known as myopia) is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred. Someone with myopia can achieve good vision with prescription glasses, contact lenses or laser surgery. Short-sightedness usually first appears in childhood."
What is strabismus?,Strabismus (or ‘squint’) is where one of your eyes points in towards your nose (convergent) or out towards your ear (divergent). Sometimes one eye may point up or down. Strabismus may be present all the time or only sometimes.
What is the Management of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"With timely screening and treatment, glaucoma can be identified at an early stage and its progress can be halted before the disease significantly affects vision. The main goal is to reduce IOP before the disease progresses to cause complete vision loss. Drugs used to treat open-angle glaucoma include alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, miotics, and prostaglandin analogs. The treatment strategy usually involves taking into consideration the risk factors, adverse effects related to the drug use, the patient’s life expectancy, medical history, and concomitant conditions. Surgery is the next option in cases where IOP worsens even after administration of the maximum tolerated medical therapy.

What is the Most Common Form of Glaucoma?,"Open-angle glaucoma, the most common formofglaucoma, is caused by blockageof the trabecular meshwork or drainage canals. The “open-angle” designation refers to the preservation of a wide and open angle between the iris and cornea. The condition develops slowly over a lifetime, and symptoms are gradual and often go unnoticed. Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by an imbalance in the production and drainage of aqueous humor (eye fluid). Blockageof drainage canals causes fluid accumulation in the eye chamber, which in turn causes increased IOP. Vision loss from this type is first evident peripherally, then moves centrally. Angle-closure glaucoma is also referred to as acute or narrow-angle glaucoma. As evident by its name, angle-closure glaucoma results from the narrowing of the angle between the iris and cornea. The condition is characterized by blocked drainage canals, which results in a sudden rise in the IOP. In contrast to open-angle glaucoma, this type develops quickly and has very noticeable symptoms. The severe nature of the condition warrants immediate medical attention and prompt treatment. Open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma can also include variants such as secondary glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma, and traumatic glaucoma. Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG) is also called normal-pressure or low-tension glaucoma. It is characterized by optic nerve damage even in the absence of high IOP. The exact mechanism that causes this damage is still a mystery. Congenital glaucoma is a rare inherited condition that develops due to the incomplete or faulty development of the drainage canals of the eye. It encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases and is further classified into the following: Congenital glaucoma- The condition exists at birth Infantile glaucoma- Identified during early childhood, normally before the age of three Juvenile glaucoma- Occurs in later childhood; from age three to the teenage years Microsurgery is the main treatment option, however, in complicated cases, a."
What is the Retina?,"Pediatric retina includes several rare diseases, many involving genetic predisposition, infection, trauma, or prematurity. Certain conditions, like retinopathy of prematurity, can develop in very premature infants while in neonatal nurseries and require multiple screenings. There are different kinds of pediatric retina conditions, including the following: Coats disease Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) Penetrating retinal injuries Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) Stargardt disease X-linked retinoschisis If you or your child notices any of the following, see a pediatric ophthalmologist: White pupils or an eye that appears white (rather than red) in photographs Full or partial vision loss Night blindness Black floaters within the field of vision Sudden, persistent flashing lights Any dramatic changes to the appearance of the eye Misalignment of the eyes or trouble focusing Sensitivity to light Pediatric surgeries are performed by University of Health physicians at the John A. Moran Eye Center Surgery Unit and at Primary Children’s Hospital, a Level Center. Both operating suites are fully equipped to perform intricate vitreoretinal procedures on premature babies, infants, and children. The anesthesiologists at Primary Children’s specialize in anesthesia services for the tiniest preterm infant on up, and are skilled in managing anesthesia for the medically complex child during difficult procedures. In Coats disease, the blood vessels in the retina leak into the back of the eye. This leakage causes the retina to swell and can eventually cause partial or complete retinal detachment. The disease can develop gradually and involves both eyes but usually causes symptoms in only one eye. Retinal detachment from Coats disease can appear like retinoblastoma, so it is important to have careful evaluations with both a pediatric retinal specialist and pediatric ophthalmologist to help ensure an accurate diagnosis and swift treatment. Treatment for Coats disease depends on the stage of the disease. If caught early, a laser can."
What is the cornea?,The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eye.Thecornea helps your eye to focus light so you can see clearly.
What is the difference between a comprehensive eye exam and a vision screening?,"Current vision screening methods cannot be relied on to effectively identify individuals who need vision care. These types of screenings are offered at schools, pediatrician offices or at the DMV. While they may uncover some vision problems, they can miss more than they find. In some cases, vision screenings can give a false sense of security for those individuals who ""pass"" the screening and inhibit the early diagnosis of vision problems. These people are then less likely to receive treatment for their vision problem and it could become worse. A comprehensive eye exam includes a range of tests in order to do a complete evaluation of the health of your eyes and your vision. Not only can your doctor of optometry assess your eye health, they can identify symptoms of conditions elsewhere in the body like brain tumors, aneurysms, high blood pressure and diabetes.

What’s the Difference Between PRK and LASIK?,"How they work Recovery Efficacy Risks Candidate Cost Pros and cons Finding a provider Takeaway PRK vs. LASIK Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are both laser surgery techniques used to help improve eyesight. PRK has been around longer, but both are still widely used today. PRK and LASIK are both used to modify thecorneaof your eye. The cornea is made up of five thin, transparent layers of tissue over the front of your eye that bend (or refract) and focus light to help you see. PRK and LASIK each use different methods to help correct your vision by reshaping cornea tissue. With PRK, your eye surgeon takes away the top layer of the cornea, known as the epithelium. Your surgeon then uses lasers to reshape the other layers of the cornea and fix any irregular curvature in your eye. With LASIK, your eye surgeon uses lasers or a tiny blade to create a small flap in your cornea. This flap is raised up, and your surgeon then uses lasers to reshape the cornea. The flap is lowered back down after the surgery is complete, and the cornea repairs itself over the next few months. Either technique can be used to help resolve eye issues related to: nearsightedness(myopia): inability to see distant objects clearly farsightedness(hyperopia): inability to see close objects clearly astigmatism: an irregular eye shape that causes blurry vision Read on to learn more about the similarities and differences of these procedures, and which one may be right for you."
What’s the treatment for amblyopia?,"If there’s a vision problem causing amblyopia, the doctor may treat that first. For example, doctors may recommend glasses or contacts (for kids who are nearsighted or farsighted) or surgery (for kids with cataract). The next step is to re-train the brain and force it to use the weaker eye. The more the brain uses it, the stronger it gets. Treatments include: Wearing an eye patch on the stronger eye.By covering up this eye with a stick-on eye patch (similar to a Band-Aid), the brain has to use the weaker eye to see. Some kids only need to wear the patch for day, while others may need to wear it whenever they're awake.

Why is cataract surgery performed?,"A cataract is an eye condition where the lens of your one or both of your eyes becomes cloudy. Cataractscan make your sight become blurry. If you have cataracts, you may also: be sensitive to bright lights see everything as slightly faded or yellow Cataracts will not get better on their own. The treatment for cataracts is surgery on your affected eye. Cataract removal is one of the most common and successful surgeries in Australia. The eye surgeon removes the cloudy lens from your eye. Then they replace it with an artificial plastic lens called an intraocular lens. Cataracts cannot come back in your treated eye. The artificial lens is made to suit your eyes. In fact, you should see clearly just a few hours after the surgery. Before surgery you will need to have some tests, including an eye test so that your replacement lens can be made to the correct strength. You may also need a blood test and heart check. Your doctor will tell you if there is anything else that you need to do before your operation. You can find out more aboutpreparing for the operation here."
Why is eye dilation important?,"Dilation allows an eye doctor to look inside your eyes. Dilating drops widen the pupil (the black part of your eye) so that it doesn’t get smaller when your doctor shines a light at it. The widened pupil allows your doctor to use a magnifying lens to look inside your eye and at the back of your eye. They’ll look at the retina, optic nerve, blood vessels, and other parts of your eye that can’t otherwise be seen. Dilation helps your eye doctor diagnose many eye conditions, including glaucoma retinal detachment age-relatedmacular degeneration diabetic retinopathy It also helps diagnose some chronic conditions that affect more than your eye, such ashigh blood pressureanddiabetes. This is because those conditions can lead to changes in the eye. For example, high blood pressure could damage the blood vessels in your retina, which can be seen only when your eye is dilated. Dilating drops can also be used to treat certain eye conditions. These include eye inflammation andamblyopia, also called a lazy eye, which is a condition where one eye doesn’t properly connect with the brain. Dilating drops used as treatment have the same effects as drops used during exams. Dilation can cause blurry vision and light sensitivity, so it’s important for you to take care of yourself and your eyes after your appointment. Have a friend or family member drive you home from your appointment, or take a taxi. Many people drive themselves home if they’ve experienced dilation in the past and feel comfortable doing so. Bring sunglasses to protect your eyes after your appointment. Sunlight might hurt your eyes. Your doctor’s office might offer sunglasses after dilation, but bringing your own never hurts. Take a few hours off work if possible. Reading may be hard, and it’s important to not strain your eyes."
