Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: What’s the Difference?,"Optometrist Ophthalmologist Optician Bottom line An optometrist treats your eyes. In contrast, an ophthalmologist focuses on doing surgical procedures for eye conditions, while an optician helps you fit eyeglasses and other vision-correcting devices. If you’ve ever had to search for an eye care doctor, you’re likely aware that there are several different types of eye specialists. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians are all professionals who specialize in eye care. In this article, we will explore the education requirements, salary, scope of practice, and services that optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians provide. We will also discuss how to choose the best eye-care professional for your needs."
What is an optometrist and what do they do?,"An optometrist is the primary health care provider for routine eye care. An optometry program is a postgraduate program that takes roughly 4 years to complete, depending on the school and curriculum. The program curriculum includes: basic and advanced eye examination techniques client case history and case studies additional courses in the natural sciences (including optics) and pharmacology Optometry program coursework also includes full-time clinical training as a resident during the final 1 to 2 years of the program. In2018, the median salary for optometrists was $111,790, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can visit an optometrist for your yearly eye exam, to refill an eyeglass or contact prescription, or even to receive medication and treatment for certain eye conditions. Unlike an ophthalmologist, an optometrist is not a surgical specialist and cannot treat more serious eye conditions. Optometrists provide the following services:: annual orroutine eye exams, including eye health education diagnosis of eye conditions prescriptions for eyeglasses, contact lenses, and other visual aids medical treatments or minor surgical procedures for eye conditions post-surgical eye care Optometrists can prescribe controlled medications for eye conditions. Depending on the state legislation, some optometrists can also perform minor surgeries. These surgical procedures."
What Are the Job Duties of an Optometrist?,"When someone starts having vision trouble, they see an optometrist for basic vision care. Optometrists do routine vision checks and tests, examine other parts of the visual system and diagnose and treat minor eye problems, diseases and injuries. If necessary, the optometrist prescribes glasses or contact lenses, finding the right vision correction level and fit for each person. They also do minor surgical procedures, offer pre- and post-op care for more involved surgeries with an ophthalmologist and promote general eye health and care."
How Do the Job Duties of an Ophthalmologist Differ From an Optometrist?,"Ophthalmologists can do all the above duties that optometrists can, as well as perform eye surgery. They have the additional skills to specialize in surgery for conditions like glaucoma and cataracts. They also perform corneal, vitro-retinal, eye muscle and oculoplastic surgeries. Before surgery even takes place, the ophthalmologist puts the patient through a complete exam to diagnose the issue and create the best treatment plan. An ophthalmologist can also treat more complicated eye injuries, including those dealing with other eye structures like the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva and eyelids."
Where Do Optometrists and Ophthalmologists Work?,"Many optometrists own their practices, sometimes working in a practice with other optometrists. Some optometrists only work with a certain population, specializing in one type of eye care such as pediatrics or low vision. Optometrists also find employment in postsecondary education, as consultants and in research roles. Ophthalmologists work in mostly in hospitals and surgery centers, but some also have their own practices. Both generally work full-time, putting in hours in the evenings and on the weekends to fit patient schedules."
What Is the Average Optometrist Salary?,"According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for optometrists was$110,300, as of May 2017. This means that half of the industry made more and half made less. Those in the top 10 percent of earners made$190,090, while the bottom 10 percent brought home less than$53,740. Optometrists employed in private doctor practices made the most at$124,060, while those in government roles made the least at$94,280. These states have the highest averageeye doctor salary: Connecticut ($192,870). Alaska ($187,800). Maryland ($141,870). Oklahoma ($136,740). Massachusetts ($135,780)."
What Is the Average Ophthalmologist Salary?,"Ophthalmologists earn an average of$357,000a year, according to the Medscape Ophthalmologist Compensation Report from 2018. The salary for self-employed ophthalmologists is$429,000, higher than the salary for those working for other entities, which is an average of$256,000. More years of experience generally equals higher pay. Those with 0 to 5 years of experience earn an average of$180,000, while 20-plus years of experience gets you about$270,000a year."
What Are the Symptoms of Glaucoma?,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision. Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: severe eye pain nausea vomiting redness in your eye sudden vision disturbances seeing colored rings around lights sudden blurred vision"
What Causes Glaucoma?,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye. What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role: dilating eye drops blocked or restricted drainage in your eye medications, such as corticosteroids poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve high or elevated blood pressure"
What Are the Types of Glaucoma?,"Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are: Open-angle, or chronic, glaucoma has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. This loss may be so slow that your vision can suffer irreparable damage before any other signs become apparent. According theNational Eye Institute (NEI), this is the most common type of glaucoma. If the flow of your aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked, the rapid buildup of fluid may cause a severe, quick, and painful increase in pressure. Angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency situation. You should call your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, and blurred vision. Children born with congenital glaucoma have a defect in the angle of their eye, which slows or prevents normal fluid drainage. Congenital glaucoma usually presents with symptoms, such as cloudy eyes, excessive tearing, or sensitivity to light. Congenital glaucoma can run in families. Secondary glaucoma is often a side effect of injury or another eye condition, such as cataracts or eye tumors. Medicines, such as corticosteroids, may also cause this type of glaucoma. Rarely, eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma. In some cases, people without increased eye pressure develop damage to their optic nerve. The cause."
What causes crossed eyes?,"Crossed eyes occur either due to nerve damage or when the muscles around your eyes don’t work together because some are weaker than others. When your brain receives a different visual message from each eye, it ignores the signals coming from your weaker eye. If your condition isn’t corrected, you may lose vision in your weaker eye. Crossed eyes are common in children. Often the underlying cause is unknown. Infantile esotropia is a type of crossed eyes that appears in babies during their first year of life. Esotropia runs in families and usually requires surgery to correct. Acquired esotropia occurs in children usuallybetween the ages of 2 and 5. Eyeglasses can usually correct it. Crossed eyes can also occur later in life. It’s usually caused by physical disorders, like eye injuries, cerebral palsy, or stroke. You may also develop crossed eyes if you have alazy eyeor arefarsighted."
How is crossed eyes diagnosed?,"To prevent vision loss, early diagnosis and treatment for crossed eyes is important. If you develop symptoms of crossed eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor. They’ll perform a series of tests to check the health of your eyes that may include: a corneal light reflex test to check for crossed eyes avisual acuity testto determine how well you can read from a distance a cover/uncover test to measure your eye movement and deviation a retina exam to examine the backs of your eyes If you have other physical symptoms along with crossed eyes, your doctor may examine your brain and nervous system for other conditions. For example, they may conduct tests to check for cerebral palsy orGuillain-Barré syndrome. It’s common for newborn babies to have crossed eyes. If your baby has crossed eyes that persist beyond 3 months of age, make an appointment with their doctor. Young children should undergo an eye exam before 3 years of age."
Who is at risk of crossed eyes?,"You’re more likely to develop crossed eyes if you: have family members who have crossed eyes have a brain disorder or brain tumor have had a stroke or brain injury have a lazy eye, are farsighted, or have vision loss have a damaged retina havediabetes"
How are crossed eyes treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan for crossed eyes will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your condition. If your crossed eyes have resulted from a lazy eye, your doctor may have you wear a patch over your stronger eye to force the muscles of your weaker eye to work harder. Your doctor might also prescribe eye drops to blur the vision in your stronger eye. They can also useBotox injectionsto weaken the muscle that’s overacting and causing the eye turn. Other potential treatments include: eye exercises corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses surgery on certain eye muscles, particularly if corrective lenses haven’t corrected the condition If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, such as abrain tumoror stroke, your doctor may prescribe medication, surgery, or other treatments."
What is the long-term outlook for crossed eyes?,"Often crossed eyes can be corrected with corrective lenses, eye patches, surgery in rare cases, or by other modalities. It’s important to seek treatment right away to lower your risk for vision loss. After you’ve received treatment, watch your eyes for changes. In some cases, the condition may come back. If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, early diagnosis and treatment may help improve your chances of recovery.

What is a doctor of optometry/optometrist?,"Doctors of optometry (O.D.s/optometrists), America’s primary eye health care providers, are the frontline of eye and vision care. Doctors of optometry are essential health care providers and are recognized as physicians under Medicare. They examine, diagnose, treat and manage diseases and disorders of the eye. In addition to providing eye and vision care, they play a major role in an individual’s overall health and well-being by detecting systemic diseases, and diagnosing, treating and managing ocular manifestations of those diseases, and providing vaccinations. Doctors of optometry: Prescribe medications, low vision rehabilitation, vision therapy, spectacle lenses, contact lenses and perform certain surgical procedures. Counsel patients regarding surgical and non-surgical options that meet their visual needs related to their occupations, avocations and lifestyle. Complete pre-professional undergraduate education in a college or university and four years of professional education at a college of optometry, leading to the doctor of optometry (O.D.) degree. Many doctors of optometry complete an additional residency in a specific area of practice. More than 30,000 doctors of optometry nationwide are available to provide high-quality eye health and vision care services.

What is a comprehensive eye exam?,"Acomprehensive eye examconducted by a doctor of optometry determines the eye and vision health of a patient. During the exam, the doctor checks not only visual acuity through refraction but also the health of your eyes, eye tissue and other diseases. Each patient's symptoms, along with the doctor of optometry’s professional judgment, will determine what tests are conducted."
Why is it important to get comprehensive eye exams with a doctor of optometry?,"An in-person, comprehensive eye exam with a doctor of optometry is the medically recognized standard to assure precise and healthy vision, identify and treat diseases, such as glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In addition, eye exams safeguard overall health by enabling the doctor todetect more than 270 serious health conditionsincluding diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases and cancers. In fact, in 2018 alone, doctors of optometry identified signs of diabetes in more than 301,000 patients who did not know they had the condition. In-person, comprehensive eye exams are one of the most important, preventive ways to preserve vision and overall health."
What is the difference between a comprehensive eye exam and a vision screening?,"Current vision screening methods cannot be relied on to effectively identify individuals who need vision care. These types of screenings are offered at schools, pediatrician offices or at the DMV. While they may uncover some vision problems, they can miss more than they find. In some cases, vision screenings can give a false sense of security for those individuals who ""pass"" the screening and inhibit the early diagnosis of vision problems. These people are then less likely to receive treatment for their vision problem and it could become worse. A comprehensive eye exam includes a range of tests in order to do a complete evaluation of the health of your eyes and your vision. Not only can your doctor of optometry assess your eye health, they can identify symptoms of conditions elsewhere in the body like brain tumors, aneurysms, high blood pressure and diabetes.

Eye Numbing Drops: Why Are They Used and Are They Safe?,"Types Uses Side effects Application and precautions Over-the-counter Summary Medical professionals use eye numbing drops to block the nerves in your eye from feeling pain or discomfort. If you’re pregnant or nursing, tell your doctor before getting eye numbing drops. Eye numbing drops are considered atopical anesthetic. They’re used duringeye examsand for surgical procedures involving your eyes. It’s important to understand the distinction between eye numbing drops (used for surgical procedures and eye exams) and other types ofeye drops. Saline drops, artificial tears, and anti-allergy or anti-histamine drops are available over-the-counter to soothe and hydrate your eyes. Antibiotic eye drops are available by prescription to treat eye injuries, likecorneal abrasions. Numbing eye drops don’t have soothing, hydrating, anti-allergy, or antibiotic properties. They’re an anesthetic medication for your eye. When administered in small doses, these drops are considered safe. However, there are some risks of side effects if they’re overused. There are two main types of eye drops used in eye exams and surgical procedures. Both are available only by prescription. Tetracaine drops (AltaCaine, Tetcaine) block the nerve endings in your eye from signaling pain to your brain. Tetracainehas been foundto cause cell death in the cells of your cornea if."
How does astigmatism affect my vision?,"Astigmatismis a common vision condition that causes blurriness or distorted vision. It can affect the way light refracts on the retina. On a prescription, this will be written as part of the cylindrical (CYL) correction. If you see no number under CYL, it means you have no astigmatism, or the astigmatism is so slight you don’t need to correct it."
What is 20/20 vision?,"20/20 vision means you have normal visual acuity (or sharpness and clarity) at a distance of 20 feet away. It doesn’t mean perfect vision, though. It only means you can see clearly at a distance. Overall visual ability also measures: peripheral or side vision eye coordination depth of perception focusing ability color vision 20/15 vision is actually better than 20/20. Someone with 20/15 vision can see objects at 20 feet away that someone with 20/20 can only see at 15 feet away. The higher the second number, the less clear and sharp you’ll see objects at a distance. Someone with 20/200 has some vision, but doesn’t see with the same clarity as people with a 20/100 or 20/40 vision. Depending on your visual acuity, your ophthalmologist or optometrist will be able to determine if eyeglasses or contacts can help. In some cases, you may not be able to get 20/20 vision with corrective lenses, but you may be able to see more clearly than you would without glasses or contacts."
Will your vision get worse?,"Vision doesn’t worsen as a result of getting older, but your risk for eye-related conditions and diseases does get increase as you age. For example, you’re at a higher risk for the following after age 50: age-relatedmacular degeneration cataracts glaucoma diabetic retinopathy For better eye health, you can try the following in addition to eating ahealthy dietand exercising regularly: wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat when you’re out in bright sunshine wear protective eyewear when playing sports, or using power tools or chemicals maintain ahealthy blood pressure"
How often should you get your eyes checked?,"Your prescription can change, so it’s important to get regular eye exams. Adults ages 19 to 40 with vision problems should get their eyes checked at least every two years. Adults older than 40 should get them checked once a year. If you’re an adult with no vision problems, get your eyes checked every five years until age 30, and then at least every 2 to 4 years from age 40 to 65. After age 65, you’ll need regular eye exams at least every two years. Let your doctor know if you notice any changes to your vision and need to be seen more often. At checkups, your doctor will also screen for eye conditions like glaucoma, which can be treated if caught early. Your vision prescription can change over time. It’s important to get regular eye checkups so your glasses and contact prescription stays up to date. Your eye doctor can also check for common eye conditions that may require additional treatment or correction. If your vision changes or you’re having trouble seeing clearly, make an appointment to get your eyes checked and let your doctor know your symptoms.

How Long Does It Take for the Effects from Eye Dilation Drops to Wear Off?,"Side effects Purpose Tips Eye health Takeaway Getting your eyes dilated is an important part of any complete eye exam. Once your doctor puts in the dilating drops, it takes about 20–30 minutes for your pupils to fully open, or dilate. After your eyes are fully dilated, the effects will last for four to six hours for most people. Some people feel the effects of dilating drops for longer, including people with lighter color eyes. Dilation in children can last up to a full day after the exam. It’s impossible for your doctor to tell you exactly how long the effects of dilation will last and how severe they will be. Everyone’s eyes react differently to dilating drops. The important thing is to use caution as long as your vision is blurry or your eyes are light-sensitive."
What are the side effects of eye dilation drops?,"Dilation is harmless in the long term, but it does come with short-term side effects. These will usually last for about four to six hours. Side effects of dilation include: light sensitivity blurry vision trouble focusing on close objects stinging right after the drops are put in If you wear contact lenses, you may not be able to wear them until the dilation drops wear off."
Why is eye dilation important?,"Dilation allows an eye doctor to look inside your eyes. Dilating drops widen the pupil (the black part of your eye) so that it doesn’t get smaller when your doctor shines a light at it. The widened pupil allows your doctor to use a magnifying lens to look inside your eye and at the back of your eye. They’ll look at the retina, optic nerve, blood vessels, and other parts of your eye that can’t otherwise be seen. Dilation helps your eye doctor diagnose many eye conditions, including glaucoma retinal detachment age-relatedmacular degeneration diabetic retinopathy It also helps diagnose some chronic conditions that affect more than your eye, such ashigh blood pressureanddiabetes. This is because those conditions can lead to changes in the eye. For example, high blood pressure could damage the blood vessels in your retina, which can be seen only when your eye is dilated. Dilating drops can also be used to treat certain eye conditions. These include eye inflammation andamblyopia, also called a lazy eye, which is a condition where one eye doesn’t properly connect with the brain. Dilating drops used as treatment have the same effects as drops used during exams. Dilation can cause blurry vision."
What’s the Difference Between PRK and LASIK?,"How they work Recovery Efficacy Risks Candidate Cost Pros and cons Finding a provider Takeaway PRK vs. LASIK Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are both laser surgery techniques used to help improve eyesight. PRK has been around longer, but both are still widely used today. PRK and LASIK are both used to modify thecorneaof your eye. The cornea is made up of five thin, transparent layers of tissue over the front of your eye that bend (or refract) and focus light to help you see. PRK and LASIK each use different methods to help correct your vision by reshaping cornea tissue. With PRK, your eye surgeon takes away the top layer of the cornea, known as the epithelium. Your surgeon then uses lasers to reshape the other layers of the cornea and fix any irregular curvature in your eye. With LASIK, your eye surgeon uses lasers or a tiny blade to create a small flap in your cornea. This flap is raised up, and your surgeon then uses lasers to reshape the cornea. The flap is lowered back down after the surgery is complete, and the cornea repairs itself over the next few months. Either technique."
What causes your eye to hurt when you blink?,"Common causes for eye pain when you blink include dry eyes, a stye, or pink eye (conjunctivitis). More serious conditions that can cause your eye to hurt when you blink include glaucoma or optic neuritis. You should see your doctor if symptoms don’t ease within 48 hours or at-home remedies aren’t effective and the pain gets worse. If the condition is more serious than a simple infection or irritation of your eye, you will need medical attention quickly. Pain when blinking is often only one symptom of a problem. Others may appear, too. If your eye pain isn’t caused by an obvious injury or condition, other symptoms can help you and your doctor understand what is causing the pain. These symptoms include: pain when moving your eyes pressure in your eyes inflammation of your eyelid or eyelash follicles pain or sensitivity when exposed to light tenderness around your eyes (the sinuses) If you experience the following symptoms when you blink, you should seek emergency medical treatment: unbearable pain impaired vision severe pain when touching your eye vomiting or abdominal pain appearance of halos around lights difficulty closing your eyelids entirely because your eye is bulging outward If you’re experiencing any."
What is an ophthalmologist?,"Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with additional specialist training in the diagnosis and management of disorders of the eye and visual system. They are also sometimes called eye doctors or eye surgeons. In Australia, ophthalmologists need to complete at least 5 years of specialist training after they become a doctor. If you have an eye disease or visual disorder, your doctor or optometrist may refer you to an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologists do surgery and prescribe contact lenses and glasses as well as medicines for eye problems."
What does an ophthalmologist do?,"Ophthalmologists are surgeons, and can do: cataract surgery, in which they replace the lens in your eye refractive or laser surgery, which involves reshaping your cornea to correctshort-sightedness,long-sightednessorastigmatism surgery to correct misalignment of your eyes, orstrabismus surgery to removecancers, such as melanoma, from the eye treatment to repair damage caused by an eye injury"
When do I see an ophthalmologist?,"Your doctor or optometrist may refer you to an ophthalmologist if you have: partial or complete loss of vision eye injuries, pain or inflammation eye conditions, such asglaucoma health conditions that can affect your eyes, includingdiabetesorhigh blood pressure poor vision that needs specialist care"
What questions should I ask an ophthalmologist?,"Before you go to your first appointment, note down any questions you have. During the consultation, ask for clarification if you don’t understand what is said. ASK YOUR DOCTOR— Preparing for an appointment? Use theQuestion Builderfor general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist."
How do I find an ophthalmologist?,"Ask your doctor or optometrist for a recommendation or use the healthdirect service finder to locate an ophthalmologist in your area. The RANZCOfind an ophthalmologisttool also allows you to search for an ophthalmologist who has a special interest, such as paediatric (children’s) ophthalmology. FIND A HEALTH SERVICE— TheService Findercan help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services."
Do I need a referral to see an ophthalmologist?,"It is important to get areferralfrom your doctor or optometrist to see an ophthalmologist. This is so that they can pass on useful important health information, and the ophthalmologist can later tell the doctor or optometrist about the results of your visit and any tests performed. If you don’t have a referral, neither Medicare nor private health insurance will contribute to the cost of your care. In an emergency, such as an eye injury or sudden loss of vision, go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital immediately, or call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance."
How much will an ophthalmologist cost?,"Thecostsof an ophthalmologist visit vary greatly, depending on the type of care you receive. Factors include whether it’s inhospital, whether you haveprivate health insurance, and what the ophthalmologistcharges. If you see an ophthalmologist in their rooms, thenMedicarewill cover: all of the costs if theybulk bill some of the costs if they don’t bulk bill You can't use private health insurance for out of hospital care. If you are a public patient in a public hospital or clinic and use Medicare, the treatment is free. If you use private health insurance for treatment in either a public hospital or a private hospital or clinic, you will be charged by the ophthalmologist and by the hospital. You might also becharged for diagnostic testing, such aspathology tests,x-raysand other forms of imaging (such as anMRI,PETorCT scan), and by other doctors who provide you care, such as an anaesthetist. If you have private health insurance, it may cover some of these costs. It can be expensive to see a specialist, such as an ophthalmologist. Before you go for the first time, ask the ophthalmologist or their staff about the costs. You can also ask what Medicare will cover. If you plan to use private health."
Why is cataract surgery performed?,"A cataract is an eye condition where the lens of your one or both of your eyes becomes cloudy. Cataractscan make your sight become blurry. If you have cataracts, you may also: be sensitive to bright lights see everything as slightly faded or yellow Cataracts will not get better on their own. The treatment for cataracts is surgery on your affected eye. Cataract removal is one of the most common and successful surgeries in Australia. The eye surgeon removes the cloudy lens from your eye. Then they replace it with an artificial plastic lens called an intraocular lens. Cataracts cannot come back in your treated eye. The artificial lens is made to suit your eyes. In fact, you should see clearly just a few hours after the surgery. Before surgery you will need to have some tests, including an eye test so that your replacement lens can be made to the correct strength. You may also need a blood test and heart check. Your doctor will tell you if there is anything else that you need to do before your operation. You can find out more aboutpreparing for the operation here."
Who does cataract surgery?,Cataract surgery is performed by anophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor). Your doctor or optometrist can help you tofind the right health professionalfor cataract treatment.
What happens during cataract surgery?,"On the day of the surgery, you will be given eye drops that include anantibiotic. You might be given an injection around your eye or eye drops to make the eye go numb. Most people have alocal anaesthetic and light sedation. During the procedure you will be asked to lie on your back. The doctor will make a small cut in your eye. This lets them remove your cloudy lens and insert the plastic lens. The operation usually takes less than 30 minutes. There will always be medical staff to talk to during the procedure. If you have any problems, you should tell one of the staff. Watch this animated video on how cataract surgery is done: Your doctor will place a pad over your eye that was operated on. You will also be given eye drops to use at home. Make sure you understand how to use them and how long you need to use them for. You might have some pain or discomfort in that eye. Tell a nurse or doctor so they can give you some pain relief medicine. Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure and does not require an overnight stay in hospital. You will need."
What is short-sightedness?,"Short-sightedness (also known as myopia) is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred. Someone with myopia can achieve good vision with prescription glasses, contact lenses or laser surgery. Short-sightedness usually first appears in childhood."
How is short-sightedness caused?,"When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) and the lens. If you have normal vision, the light waves are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are short-sighted, the light waves from distant objects focus in front of, rather than on, the retina. Short-sightedness usually appears in the pre-teen years and often gets worse for a few years. It can also develop later — even in early adulthood. It is becoming more common. Myopia has been linked to spending many hours doing activities such as reading, schoolwork or using a computer, while spending less time outdoors. You can also inherit short-sightedness from your parents."
How is short-sightedness diagnosed?,An eye test using an eye chart will allow an optometrist or ophthalmologist to diagnose short-sightedness. Children should have their vision checked when they start both primary and secondary schools.
How is short-sightedness treated?,"Short-sightedness is usually corrected with prescription glasses. Contact lenses are also an option, but generally not for children.Laser refractive eye surgeryis now also common, but is only appropriate for adults. Some research suggests that certain treatments might be able to slow the progression of short-sightedness in children. If you want to know more about this, talk to your optometrist or doctor. Even if you have no concerns about your vision, it is a good idea to have your eyes checked every 2 years. Learn more here about thedevelopment and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

What is long-sightedness?,"Long-sightedness (also known as hyperopia) is a common eye condition that can be hard to detect. It makes close objects appear blurry, or you might be able to focus clearly but get tired eyes or headaches. For people with significant long-sightedness, vision can be blurry for things in the distance as well."
How is long-sightedness caused?,"The size and shape of the eye largely causes long-sightedness. When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye, and the lens. This process is known as refraction. If you have normal vision, the rays of light are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are long-sighted, the cornea is not sufficiently curved or the eye is too short, so the light rays from close objects focus behind, rather than on, the retina when the eye is resting (not actively focusing on something). Many people are slightly long-sighted and the lens automatically corrects for the refractive error by adjusting the focus to get a sharp image. People who are more long-sighted, or who do a lot of near-focus activities such as reading, need more adjustment. This means their eyes can get tired by the end of the day and they might get headaches. You have a slightly higher chance of being long-sighted if either of your parents is long-sighted."
How is long-sightedness diagnosed?,"Standard vision screening tests might not detect long-sightedness, but an optometrist or ophthalmologist can measure how well your eye focuses as part of an eye examination. Mild long-sightedness, especially in young people, might not need any treatment. If moderate to severe long-sightedness is not corrected, however, the extra focusing effort required may increase the likelihood of children developinglazy eye(amblyopia) orturned eyes(also known as a squint, or strabismus). The most common treatment is glasses, especially for reading and other near work, but sometimes also for distance. Your optometrist might recommend eye exercises. Laser refraction surgerycan correct long-sightedness, and might be suitable for adults, although it is not recommended for children. Even if you have no concerns about your vision, it is best to have your eyes checked every 2 years. Learn more here about thedevelopment and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a commoneyecondition where the cornea or lens in your eye is not perfectly curved. Instead of being shaped like a soccer ball, it is curved like a rugby ball. This means that light entering the eye focuses at 2 places (rather than one) on the retina. This can make your vision mildly or severely blurry. Your ability to see both close up (long-sightedness) and far away (short-sightedness) are affected. There are 2 types of astigmatism: regular —the cornea is curved more in one direction (e.g. vertically) than the other (e.g. horizontally) irregular —the curvature of the cornea is uneven across the surface of the eye"
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"Symptoms of astigmatism may include: difficulty focusing blurred vision, both close up (long-sightedness or hyperopia) or far away (short-sightedness or myopia) headaches eyestrain and squinting difficulty seeing at night — you may see halos (spots of light) or glares fatigue ‘lazy eye’in children CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help."
What causes astigmatism?,"There are several potential causes of astigmatism, including: inherited orcongenitalcauses (being born with astigmatism) eye injury a complication following eye surgery ageing other eye conditions such askeratoconus"
When should I have an eye test?,"You should have an eye test if you experience any trouble with your vision, for example: blurry vision trouble focusing difficulty seeing at night squinting headaches See your optometrist if you suspect your child is having any issues with their sight, or before starting school, to identify any problems early for better vision outcomes.

How is astigmatism diagnosed?,"Your optometrist orophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor)can diagnose astigmatism with an eye examination. Testing may include: vision testing to see how clearly you see (visual acuity test) measurement of the curve of your corneas measurement of how well your eyes focus light If you have any concerns about your eyesight, see your optometrist or talk to your doctor."
How is astigmatism treated?,"Your healthcare professional can treat your astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses. Most people have mild astigmatism, and this treatment is enough. If you have severe astigmatism, you may need more extensive treatment with rigid contact lenses or laser eye surgery that can adjust your cornea’s shape.

What is strabismus?,Strabismus (or ‘squint’) is where one of your eyes points in towards your nose (convergent) or out towards your ear (divergent). Sometimes one eye may point up or down. Strabismus may be present all the time or only sometimes.
How does strabismus happen?,"Strabismus in adults can happen because of disease that affects your eye muscles (such as thyroid eye disease and myasthenia), disease that affects the nerves to your eye muscles (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) or trauma (where a physical force is applied directly to your eye). Strabismus can also be caused by trying to correct short- or long-sightedness, or by poor vision in one eye as a result of amblyopia (or ‘lazy eye’). Strabismus may not cause any symptoms. For some people it can be serious."
What is eye cancer?,Eye cancer develops when abnormal cells in your eye grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Many different cancers can affect theeyesor the muscles and tissue around the eye. Eye cancers are sometimes called 'intraocular cancers.'
What are the types of eye cancer?,"If the cancer starts to grow in the eye itself, it is called a primary cancer. If the cancer spreads to the eye (metastasises) from another body part, such as thebreastorlungsit is called a secondary cancer. There are a few different types of primary eye cancer. The most common form of primary eye cancer in adults is melanoma. It is quite different to themelanomayou get on your skin as it can start in a part of the body that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Eye melanoma, also called 'ocular melanoma' or 'uveal melanoma', grows in the cells of the eye that produce melanin (the pigment that gives your skin its colour). It affects the middle of the three layers of the wall of the eye which contains a few separate parts. It can affect any of the parts in this layer. You can't see ocular melanoma by looking in a mirror. Another type of rare eye cancer islymphoma, which affects yourimmune systemand usually starts in your glands (lymph nodes). Retinoblastoma is a cancer which grows in the cells of the retina (the part of the back of the eye that senses light). It can grow in one or both."
What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common eye problem that causes vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve. If untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness. Usually the deterioration in vision is very gradual and not noticeable, so regulareye examinationsare recommended for people from middle age. Once detected, glaucoma can be treated to prevent or delay further vision damage."
What are the types of glaucoma?,"There are several different types of glaucoma. The 2 main types of glaucoma are: open-angle — where fluid pressure builds up in the front part of the eye even when the fluid drainage pathways are open closed-angle (or angle-closure) — where the eye’s fluid drainage pathways are narrowed or closed, so fluid pressure builds up quickly, which may cause pain in the eye and sudden loss of vision Different types of open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma can be categorised as either: primary glaucoma — with an unknown cause; or secondary glaucoma — caused by an eye condition, such as surgery, trauma, drugs or eye disease Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma in Australia."
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"Most people with glaucoma have few or no symptoms until their eyesight is damaged. If you haveprimary open angle glaucomayou may have no symptoms, or you may lose peripheral vision at first. You might not notice this until there is significant optic nerve damage. If you havechronic angle-closure glaucomayou sometimes get vision problems, such as a halo-like image around lights or you may have no symptoms. If you haveacute angle-closure glaucomayou may get sudden, severe eye pain with nausea and vomiting, headache, watery eyes,blurred vision, and halos around bright lights. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency, and you should seek treatment straight away so you don’t lose vision. Go to your nearestemergency departmentor call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance. CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help."
What causes glaucoma?,"Doctors don’t clearly understand why glaucoma happens. Glaucoma refers to a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve that links theeyeto the brain. The optic nerve carries signals from the back of your eye to the brain and allows you to see. Nerve damage can result from problems with the fluid in the eye. Sometimes, the pressure of the fluid inside the eye rises, and the fluid presses hard on the optic nerve, damaging it. Glaucoma can sometimes occur even when the fluid pressure in the eye is normal."
Who is at risk of glaucoma?,You are at higher risk of developing glaucoma if you: have a close relative with glaucoma have high eye pressure are over 50 areshort-sightedorlong-sighted use (or have used) cortisone (steroid) medications for long periods havediabetesor havehighorlow blood pressure havemigraine headaches have had an eye operation or eye injury
How is glaucoma diagnosed?,"An optometrist orophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor) can detect it early on if you have regulareye examinationsevery 1 to 2 years. They will look at the nerve fibres and the structure of the eye drainage network, test the field of vision and measure the eye pressure. This examination will take 20 to 45 minutes. If you are of African or Asian descent, these regular examinations should start at age 40. Otherwise, you should start them at age 50.

How is glaucoma treated?,"If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you need prompt treatment to reduce the pressure. This may be done with eye drops or an intravenous medicine. You may also need surgery. Nerve cells damaged by glaucoma can’t be repaired. Treatment is designed to prevent or slow further damage, mainly by reducing the pressure in the eye. This may involve: eye drops or oral medicine laser surgeryor other surgery to open or create a new drainage channel Glaucoma surgeryis usually an outpatient or day-surgery procedure. You might have alocal anaesthetic(such as eye drops) or ageneral anaesthetic. Your surgeon will explain to you the preferred type of surgery and anaesthetic for your condition."

What is uveitis?,"Uveitis is inflammation that occurs in the eye. Inflammation is normally one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as uveitis, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Uveitis is the most common eye problem associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Uveitis is more common in children who have a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)."
What are the symptoms of uveitis?,"There are different kinds of uveitis associated with JIA. The most common form of uveitis has no symptoms (‘silent uveitis’), which is why regular eye check ups are essential. However your child may complain of blurring of vision, sensitivity to light, and, rarely, eye redness or pain. If left untreated, uveitis can result in loss of vision."
What causes uveitis in JIA?,"The immune system, which usually fights infections, attacks the inner part of the eye. No one knows why this occurs in JIA patients."
How is uveitis diagnosed?,"As there may be no symptoms, all children with JIA need to be regularly assessed by an ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor). The ophthalmologist will look into the back of your child’s eyes with a special microscope called a slit lamp. Some children may be assessed by an optometrist, particularly older children (e.g. over 8 years of age). How often each child needs to be seen will be decided by their ophthalmologist or optometrist. For children without uveitis they may be seen initially every three months then over time this may extend to less often (e.g. six monthly). Children with active uveitis may need to be seen much more often by an ophthalmologist but your child’s doctor will direct this plan."
How is uveitis treated?,"If uveitis occurs, the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist will work together to treat your child to prevent permanent eye damage. Treatment may require steroid eye drops. Sometimes other eye drops are required. If the eye drops don’t control the uveitis or the uveitis is severe, your child may require other medicines by mouth or injection. These medicines aim to suppress their immune system and may include methotrexate and TNF blockers. Some children who develop complications of severe uveitis may require eye surgery to improve their vision and protect their eyes."
What is retinal detachment?,"Retinal detachment occurs when the retina, the light-sensitive nerve tissue lining the inside of the eye, becomes separated from where it is normally attached at the back of the eye. When this happens, the retina stops functioning, causing loss of vision. The retina is responsible for converting light into nerve impulses that are then sent along the optic nerve to the brain. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency. If not treated properly, it can lead to permanent blindness in the affected eye when the retina becomes permanently detached. Although retinal detachment is rare, affecting 1 in 10,000 Australians every year, the consequences can be catastrophic loss of sight, so if you have symptoms of retinal detachment, such as sudden onset of floaters or flashes, you should contact an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) or your doctor immediately. This could save your sight. Retinal detachment may start with tears or holes in the retina – if these aren’t treated they may lead to retinal detachment. Symptoms of retinal detachment may include: Sudden onset of, or a sudden increase in,‘floaters’(dark moving specks or ‘cobwebs’) andflashes(momentary flashes of light like a camera flash or lightning bolt) that appear in your vision. Sudden deterioration in, or."
Does your child need to see a health professional about lazy eye symptoms?,"Yes. If you notice that your child has any of the signs above or you’re worried about your child’s vision, start by seeing yourGPorchild and family health nurse. They can refer your child to anoptometristorophthalmologistif your child needs more tests and checks. If your child is referred to an optometrist or ophthalmologist to test for lazy eye, this professional will carefully examine your child’s eyes and vision to diagnose lazy eye and work out what’s causing it. Lazy eye diagnosis involves various tests and tools. For example, the optometrist or ophthalmologist: will check your child’s vision using an eye chart that has letters or symbols on it might use medication like eye drops to measure the focus of your child’s eyes might use equipment like a retinoscope to work out whether glasses might help your child’s lazy eye. Early diagnosis and treatment of lazy eye is essential. The earlier lazy eye is treated, the better the outcomes are for children. If lazy eye is left untreated, it can cause permanent vision loss. Lazy eye in children can usually be corrected with the right treatment. Treatments for lazy eyeaim to strengthen the lazy eye and get it working properly. The specific."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error where the front surface of the eye (the cornea) or the lens inside the eye has an irregular curvature which causes the vision to be distorted and blurred. For example, instead of having a round, spherical curvature like a basketball, the cornea may be elongated like a rugby ball. Light rays entering an astigmatic eye are bent unevenly. As a result, these rays do not focus at a single point on the retina, causing some parts of the image to be more out of focus than others. There are a number of different types of astigmatism. These include: simple; compound; mixed; regular; irregular; corneal; and lenticular. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness (myopia) and far-sightedness (hypermetropia). The exact cause remains unknown; however, some common types of astigmatism seem to run in families and may be inherited. It is thought that most people have some form of astigmatism as it is rare to find perfectly shaped curves in the cornea and lens, but the defect is rarely serious. Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea is highly astigmatic and may cause severely distorted vision. Blurred or distorted vision, eye strain and headaches are possible."
What Is the Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Test?,"An antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test is a blood test that helps distinguish ulcerative colitis from Crohn's. Newly Diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis?With ulcerative colitis, you’ll want to know what could happen and how to handle it."
What Is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a condition that damages your eye's optic nerve, and it gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your eye. Glaucoma tends to run in families. You usually don’t get it until later in life. The increased pressure in your eye, called intraocular pressure, can damage your optic nerve that sends images to your brain. If the damage worsens, glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. What glaucoma looks like within the eye. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. Visit your eye doctor regularly so they can diagnose and treat glaucoma before you have long-term vision loss. If you lose vision, it can’t be brought back, but lowering eye pressure can help you keep the sight you have. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regulareye examsare able to keep their vision. The fluid inside your eye, called aqueous humor, usually flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel. If this channel gets blocked or the eye is producing too much fluid, the liquid builds up. Sometimes, experts don’t know what causes this blockage, but it can."
What Is Pink Eye?,"Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is aninflammationof the conjunctiva -- the thin, clear tissue that lies over the white part of theeyeand lines the inside of the eyelid. Pink eye can be contagious and is often associated with children, but anyone can get it. Treatment will depend on whether your pink eye is due to a virus, bacteria, allergies, or an irritating substance. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Pink eye causes redness, itching, pain, burning, discharge, and swelling in and around the eyes. It might make your vision blurry and make you sensitive to light, but you’ll still be able to see. Pink eye can happen to anyone, regardless of age, but it's common in children. It can be highly contagious, spreading rapidly in schools and day-care centers, but it’s rarely serious. It's unlikely to damage your vision, especially if you find and treat it quickly. When you take care to prevent its spread and do everything your doctor suggests, pink eye clears up with no long-term problems. What does pink eye look like?"
What does pink eye look like?,"Pink eye looks like the whites of one or both eyes are pink or red. You may have swelling around your eyes and could see white, yellow, or green discharge. Pink eye vs. stye Stye and pink eye are eye infections with similar symptoms. Like pink eye, symptoms of a stye include itchy, sore, and watery eyes and sensitivity to light. But unlike conjunctivitis, a stye causes a small pus-filled bump in the upper or lower eyelid. It also happens due to a bacterial infection, most commonlyStaphylococcus aureusandStaphylococcus epidermidis."
How Do You Get Pink Eye?,"Several things could be to blame, but the most common causes of pink eye are: Viruses, including the kind that causes the common cold Bacteria Allergens such as pollen, dust, or smoke. It could also be due to a special type of allergy that affects some people who wearcontact lenses. Other causes include: Irritants such as shampoos, dirt, smoke, and pool chlorine A reaction to eye drops A reaction to wearing contact lens Fungi, amoebas, and parasites Conjunctivitis sometimes results from anSTD.Gonorrheacan bring on a rare but dangerous form of bacterial conjunctivitis. It can lead to vision loss if you don’t treat it.Chlamydiacan cause conjunctivitis in adults. If you have chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other bacteria in your body when you give birth, you can pass pink eye to your baby through your birth canal. Pink eye, caused by some bacteria and viruses, can spread quickly from person to person. But it isn’t a serious health risk if diagnosed promptly. However, if it happens in a newborn, tell a doctor immediately, as it might be an infection that can affect the baby’s eyesight. Who is at risk for pink eye?"
Who is at risk for pink eye?,"Though pink eye can happen to anyone, newborn babies are at a higher risk of having it. You also may be more at risk if: You interact with someone who has pink eye. You just had a cough, cold, or other respiratory infection. You wear contact lenses. You’ve been exposed to an allergen. Pink eye and COVID-19 Pink eye may be the only symptom of COVID when the virus infects the eyes, according to a 2020 case report. But more research is needed, as it's rarely the sole COVID symptom. Most people with COVID show symptoms such as fever or chills, cough, tiredness, difficulty breathing, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting, and body aches. Is pink eye contagious?"
Is pink eye contagious?,"Pink eye may be contagious, depending on the type. Cases caused by a viral or bacterial infection can spread to other people, but those caused by allergies or irritants don’t. Pink eye symptoms may be the same regardless of their cause. It's hard to know which type of conjunctivitis you have without your doctor testing it. So, regularly wash your hands and avoid touching your eyes to prevent spreading or catching it. Viral pink eye Viral pink eye is the most common and may be the most contagious form. It's usually caused by the virus that causes the common cold. It tends to start in one eye, causing lots of tears and a watery discharge. Within 24-48 hours, it affects the other eye, too. You might feel aswollen lymph nodein front of your ear or under your jawbone. You may also have cold symptoms such as a fever, sore throat, and runny nose. Viral pink eye has no cure but will go away on its own. Your symptoms may worsen in the first 3-5 days, but you’ll get better within 1-3 weeks. Bacterial pink eye Bacteria that cause pink eye include: Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Chlamydia."
What Causes Dry Eyes?,"What Causes Dry Eyes? How Are Dry Eyes Treated? Even when you’re happy, your eyes are full of tears. They provide moisture and lubrication to help you see and keep your peepers comfortable. What’s in a tear? They’re a mix of: Water, for moisture Oils, for lubrication Mucus, for even spreading Antibodies and special proteins that keep infection at bay The ingredients come from special glands around your eye. Dry eyes often mean your tear system is out of whack. When tears don’t provide enough moisture, you might notice: A gritty feeling Feeling like there’s something in your eye Itching Redness Blurry vision Light sensitivity Sometimes, dry eyes create too many tears. This confusing condition is calledreflex tearing. It happens because the lack of moisture irritates your eye. It sends a distress signal through your nervous system for more lubrication. Your body sends a flood of tears to try to make up for the dryness. It’s a lot like what happens when you get sand in your eye and it runs. But these tears are mostly water, so they don’t act like normal tears. They can wash debris away, but they can’t coat your eye’s surface."
What Causes Dry Eyes?,"Sometimes, there's a lack of balance in your tear-flow system. Or your air conditioner, heater, or other things around you could dry out your tear film. Other causes include: The natural aging process, especially menopause Side effects of certain drugs likeantihistamines Diseases that affect your ability to make tears, like Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and collagen vascular diseases Problems that don’t allow your eyelids to close the way they should"
How Are Dry Eyes Treated?,"There are a number of options. Ask your eye doctor what to do. Treatments include: Artificial tear drops and ointments.This is the most common treatment. Many types of drops are available over the counter. No one product works for everyone, so you might have to try a few to figure out the one that’s right for you. If you havechronic dry eye, you need to use the drops even when your eyes feel fine, or they won’t stay wet enough. If your eyes dry out while you sleep, you can use a thick product, like an ointment, at night. You might think about sleeping with airtight goggles on. They'll create a mini ""moisture chamber"" for your eyes. Temporary punctal occlusion.Your doctor might opt to close the punctum, or duct that drains tears from your eye. They might start with a temporary plug designed to dissolve over time. Based on how it works, your doctor will know whether permanent plugs will help.

Or they could choose a procedure called."
What Is a Stye?,"If you notice a bump that looks like a pimple on your upper or lower eyelid, it might be a stye. It's an infection in the oil glands around the eyelids and most often shows up next to your eyelashes. Usually, this red, painful bump filled with pus lasts a few days, then bursts and heals. But in some cases, you'll need treatment for the infection. You usually get a stye in one eye at a time. Some people get them repeatedly. Chalazion vs. stye A chalazion is a different kind of eyelid bump. It most often shows up on the underside of your upper eyelid. But you can get one on the lower lid, too. It's caused by blocked oil glands in your lid, not an infection. But it can sometimes form after a stye. Unlike a stye, it's usually not painful. Chalazia (the plural of chalazion) often last longer than styes, for weeks or months, but usually go away on their own. Stye vs. pink eye Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is inflammation of the membrane lining your inner eyelid and the surface of your eyeball. The telltale sign is that the whites of your eye look reddish or."
What Is Astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a condition in which your eye, especially your cornea or the clear front part of the eyeball, isn’t completely round. Almost all of us have some degree of astigmatism. Ideally, an eyeball is shaped like a perfectly round ball. Light comes into it and bends evenly, which gives you a clear view. But if your cornea is shaped more like a football, light gets bent more in one direction than another. That means only part of an object is in focus. Things at a distance may look blurry and wavy. It’s common to have astigmatism along withnearsightedness(myopia) orfarsightedness(hyperopia). These three conditions are called refractive errors because they involve how your eyes bend (or refract) light. Astigmatism is fairly easy for an eye doctor to fix with glasses, contacts, or surgery. Symptoms of astigmatismmay include: Blurry or distorted vision Eyestrain Headaches Trouble seeingat night Is astigmatism genetic?"
Is astigmatism genetic?,"Experts think the condition is genetic, meaning if you have it, you're more likely to pass it on to your children. Astigmatism happens when your cornea is irregularly shaped, bending light in one direction more than another and leaving only part of an object in focus. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Most people are born with it, but experts don’t know why. You can also get it after an eye injury, an eye disease, or surgery. Rarely, a condition calledkeratoconuscan cause astigmatism by making the clear front part of your eye (your cornea) thinner and more cone-shaped. You’ll probably need contacts (but not glasses) to see clearly. You can’t get astigmatism from reading in low light or sitting too close to the TV. Astigmatism symptoms come on slowly. Go to aneye doctorif you notice changes in your vision.You’ll need a complete eye exam. Your doctor will test the sharpness of your eyesight by asking you to read an eye chart.

Keratometer.This machine measures the bend in the center of yourcornea. It."
What Is an Ophthalmologist?,"An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who is able to treat complicated eye problems with surgery or other procedures. Ophthalmologists attend medical school. After that, they have a 1-year internship and a residency of 3 years. That's sometimes followed by a fellowship of 1-2 years. These eye doctors offer complete eye care services: Vision services, including eye exams.

This is especially important if you have headaches or other problems like: Eye discomfort Double vision A big change in vision Your eyes might get tired easily if you stare for long periods at a computer, smartphone, or game console."
What Is LASIK Eye Surgery?,"LASIK, which stands for laser in-situ keratomileusis, is a popular surgery that can correctvisionin people who arenearsightedorfarsighted, or who haveastigmatism. It’s one of many vision correction surgeries that work by reshaping your cornea, the clear front part of youreye, so that light focuses on the retina in the back of your eye."
Why Is LASIK Done?,"When light doesn’t focus on your retina the way it should, yourvisionis blurry. Doctors call this a refractive error. The basic types include: Nearsightedness (myopia).You see things clearly when they’re close to you, but things farther away are blurry. Farsightedness (hyperopia).You see faraway things more clearly, but closer things are blurry. Astigmatism.This can make everything blurry because of how youreyeis shaped. Talk to your doctor about whether LASIK is right for you. You shouldn’t have the surgery if you: Are younger than 18 Arepregnantor nursing Take certainmedications Have a lot of recent changes to your vision prescription Have thin or uneven corneas Have eye conditions such asglaucomaor verydry eyes Have other health issues such asdiabetes,lupus, orrheumatoid arthritis The benefits of LASIK include: It’s been around for over 25 years. About 96% of patients reach their vision goals afterward. An enhancement can raise this number even more. There’s very little, if any,paininvolved. There aren’t any bandages orstitches. If your vision changes as you age, your doctor can adjust it. You probably won’t need to use glasses or contacts as much, or at all, after LASIK. As with any surgery, LASIK carries some risks, including: It’s a complex procedure. It’s rare, but."

What Is Macular Degeneration?,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a problem with yourretina. It happens when a part of the retina called themaculais damaged.In this article:The two types of AMDWho is at risk for AMD?AMD diagnosisAMD treatmentMaking the most of the vision you haveTest your vision with the Amsler gridWith AMD you lose your central vision. You cannot see fine details, whether you are looking at something close or far. But your peripheral (side) vision will still be normal. For instance, imagine you are looking at a clock with hands. With AMD, you might see the clock’s numbers but not the hands.AMD is very common. It is a leading cause of vision loss in people 50 years or older.Video: How the Eye Works and AMDTwo Types of AMDDry AMDThis form is quite common. About 80% (8 out of 10) of people who have AMD have the dry form. Dry AMD is when parts of the macula get thinner with age and tiny clumps of protein calleddrusengrow. People with dry AMD may have drusen, pigment abnormalities, orgeographic atrophy(an area of cell loss in the retina). You slowly lose central vision.Video: What Is Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration?Wet AMDThis form is less common but much more serious.."
What Is the Main Cause of Astigmatism?,Astigmatism is caused by acorneaorlensthat has a different shape than normal. Astigmatism is very common. Doctors don't know why the shape of the cornea or lens varies from person to person. But they do know the risk of getting astigmatism is inherited (passed down from parents). People can also get astigmatism from: eye disease eye injury or after surgery It is a myth that reading in low light or sitting very close to the television causes astigmatism or makes it worse.
How Does Astigmatism Affect Vision?,"Normally, the cornea and lens at the front of the eye have an evenly round shape. This helps focus light rays sharply onto the retina so you can see clearly. With astigmatism, light rays do not refract (or bend) properly as they enter the front of the eye. Vision is blurry at near and far because light rays either fall short of the retina or behind it. People may have astigmatism along with other refractive errors, such as: nearsightedness (myopia)or farsightedness (hyperopia). In a normal eye, the cornea and lens focus light rays on the retina, as shown below:  In astigmatism, images focus in front of and beyond the retina, as shown below. Close and distant objects both appear blurry."
How Can You Tell if You Have Astigmatism?,"Astigmatism symptoms may include: blurry vision or areas of distorted vision eyestrain headaches squinting to try to see clearly, or eye discomfort These symptoms do not always mean you have astigmatism. See your ophthalmologist for acomprehensive eye examto find out what is causing your symptoms. Children may not realize they have blurry visionand are unlikely to complain about blurred or distorted vision. But without treatment, astigmatism can: impact a child's performance in school and sports lead to amblyopia (lazy eye)and vision loss This is why early childhood eye screenings—by a pediatrician, family doctor or other eye care professional—are so important. If astigmatism or another eye problem is found, see an ophthalmologist to get the right treatment. Ophthalmologists can diagnose astigmatism during a comprehensive eye exam. Testing may include: Eye chart.You will be asked to read letters on an eye chart. This tests forvisual acuity or sharpness of your visionat certain distances. Phoropter.This is where you look through a large binocular-like device and tell your doctor which letter you can see better. Based on your answers, your doctor writes a prescription to provide you with the clearest vision possible. Autorefractor.This device also helps measure your astigmatism or other refractive error. It."
What Are Dilating Eye Drops?,"Yourpupilsare the round, black openings at the center of youriris(the colored part of your eye). Your iris opens and closes the pupil to allow more or less light into the eye.For your eye doctor to look inside your eyes, your pupils must be dilated (widened). Dilating eye drops enlarge your pupils and keep them from getting smaller when the doctor shines light in your eyes.What to Expect When Your Eyes Are DilatedYour eye doctor will put a small amount of dilating eye drops into each of your eyes. It usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes for your pupils to fully open. Light-colored eyes (such as blue, green or hazel) will dilate faster than brown eyes.While your eyes are dilated, your vision will beblurry. You will have trouble focusing on close objects. You also will be extrasensitive to bright light. If your eyes will be dilated foran examor procedure, bringsunglasseswith you. They will help with the glare and light sensitivity when you leave your appointment.The effects of dilating eye drops last a few to several hours. Your eye doctor cannot tell you how blurry your vision will be and for how long. That depends on the type of dilating eye."
What Does a Scratched Eye Feel Like?,"Some common symptoms of a scratched eye include: Eye pain Afeeling that something is stuck in your eye Tearing If you've scratched the white part of your eye, you may see aspot of blood, a scratched line or an area of general redness on yourconjunctivaorsclera. If you've scratched or scraped yourcornea— the clear, round dome at the front of the eye, that covers theirisandpupil— you may experience moresevere symptoms: Blurry vision Sensitivity to light Headache This is called acorneal abrasionand it can permanently affect your vision. It's important to see anophthalmologistright away. If you're in a lot of pain, are having any trouble seeing or are worried about your eye, go to the emergency room."
Can a Scratched Eye Heal on its Own?,"Sometimes. Most corneal abrasions and eye scratches are minor and will heal on their own in a few days, but it's always a good idea to see a doctor for aneye exam. It's important not to useanyeye drops without first asking a doctor. There are no over-the-counter eye drops specifically for eye scratches. Your ophthalmologist may treat an eye scratch with antibiotic eye drops or ointment. Steroid eye drops may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and reduce the chance of scarring. You may also be givenlubricating eye dropsto make you more comfortable."
How Should I Treat an Eye Scratch or Scrape?,"Here are some do's and don'ts when caring for an eye scratch: Do rinse your eye with saline solution or clean water.If you don't have an eyecup, use a small, clean glass. Rest the rim of the glass on the bone at the base of your eye socket, below your lowereyelid. The water or saline solution may flush the foreign object from your eye. Do blink.Blinking can help get rid of small bits of dust or sand in your eye. Do pull your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid.Thelashesfrom your lower eyelid may be able to brush away any foreign object caught underneath your upper eyelid. Do wear sunglasses.If your eye is sensitive to light because of the scratch,sunglasseswill make you more comfortable while you heal. Don't rub your eye.Rubbing your eye can make the scratch worse. Don't touch your eye with anything.Fingers, cotton swabs and other objects won't help remove any foreign objects and could hurt your eye more. The object that caused the scratch may be gone even though you still feel like something is in your eye. Don't wear your contact lenses.Wearing yourcontact lenseswill slow the healing process and could cause complications, like contact lens-related infections. Don't."
Amblyopia: What Is Lazy Eye?,"Amblyopia is when vision in one or both eyes does not develop properly during childhood. It is sometimes called lazy eye. Amblyopia is a common problem in babies and young children.Achild’s vision develops in the first few years of life. It is important to diagnose andtreat amblyopiaas early as possible. Otherwise, a child with amblyopia will not develop normal, healthy vision.What Is the Cause of Lazy Eye?Amblyopia can develop from other eye and vision problems. Here are some conditions that may cause amblyopia in a child.StrabismusStrabismusis when the eyes point in two different directions. One eye may be focused straight ahead while the other turns in, out, up, or down. To avoidseeing double, the child's brain may ignore the image from the eye that is not focused straight ahead. But this can keep that eye from developing properly.Refractive errorsHaving a refractive error means beingnearsighted,farsighted, or havingastigmatism(distorted orblurry vision). A child may have a refractive error that is worse in one eye. That eye can ""turn off,"" and vision will not develop properly. This can be difficult to tell since the child's vision seems fine when using both eyes.Cloudiness in the normally clear parts of the eyeSome children are born with."
Nearsightedness: What Is Myopia?,"Nearsightedness (myopia) is when close-up objects look clear but distant objects are blurry. For instance, you can read a map clearly but have trouble seeing well enough to drive a car.Video: How the Eye WorksNearsightedness: Myopia TypesNearsightedness: Myopia SymptomsNearsightedness: Myopia CausesVideo: Nearsightedness (Myopia)Nearsightedness: Myopia DiagnosisNearsightedness: Myopia TreatmentNearsightedness: Myopia PreventionAdditional Information About MyopiaNearsightedness is a common eye focusing disorder. It has been on the rise for several decades. It is estimated that by 2050, nearly half the people in the world will have nearsightedness.Video: How the eye worksNearsightedness: Myopia TypesHigh myopia and low myopia.Mild nearsightedness (generally less than 3 diopters of myopia) is also called low myopia. Moderate nearsightedness or myopia is 3 to 6 diopters of myopia. Severe nearsightedness (more than 6 diopters of myopia) is also called high myopia. Nearsighted children usually become more nearsighted as they age, but their glasses prescription usually stabilizes in their 20s.Nearsightedness: Myopia SymptomsSome of the signs and symptoms of myopia include:eyestrain,headaches,squintingto see properly, anddifficulty seeing objects far away, such as road signs or a blackboard at school.Young children with myopia might not complain about their blurry vision,so eye exams and vision tests are important in young children.

How will my eye doctor check for AMD?,"Eye doctors can check for AMD as part of a comprehensive dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for AMD and other eye problems. Your doctor may also recommend doing a test called optical coherence tomography (OCT). In an OCT test, your eye doctor will take pictures of the inside of your eye with a special machine."
How do I live with vision loss from AMD?,"Not everyone with AMD develops late AMD or gets it in both eyes. But if you do, living with vision loss from AMD can be challenging. Having low vision means that even with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery, your vision loss makes it hard to do everyday tasks. The good news is, there are things that can help — like low vision devices and vision rehab services. Vision rehab can help you learn the skills you need to stay independent and active with low vision. Do you have AMD? This guide makes it easy to talk with your doctor about what this means. It includes: Information about AMD Questions for the doctor A symptom tracker"
What is amblyopia?,"Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor visionthat usually happens in just 1 eye but less commonly in both eyes. It develops when there’s a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and the brain can’t recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other, stronger eye — while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. It’s called “lazy eye” because the stronger eye worksbetter. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and they can’t control the way their eyes work. Amblyopia starts in childhood, and it’s the most common cause of vision loss in kids. Up to 3 out of 100 children have it. The good news is that early treatment works well and usually prevents long-term vision problems."
What are the symptoms of amblyopia?,"Symptoms of amblyopia can be hard to notice. Kids with amblyopia may have poor depth perception — they have trouble telling how near or far something is. Parents may also notice signs that their child is struggling to see clearly, like: Squinting Shutting 1 eye Tilting their head In many cases, parents don’t know their child has amblyopia until a doctor diagnoses it during an eye exam. That’s why it’s important for all kids to get a vision screening at least once between ages 3 and 5."
Is my child at risk for amblyopia?,"Some kids are born with amblyopia and others develop it later in childhood. The chances of having amblyopia are higher in kids who: Were born early (premature) Were smaller than average at birth Have a family history of amblyopia, childhood cataracts, or other eye conditions Have developmental disabilities"
What causes amblyopia?,"In many cases, doctors don’t know the cause of amblyopia. But sometimes, a different vision problem can lead to amblyopia. Normally, the brain uses nerve signals from both eyes to see. But if an eye condition makes vision in 1 eye worse, the brain may try to work around it. It starts to “turn off” signals from the weaker eye and rely only on the stronger eye. Some eye conditions that can lead to amblyopia are: Refractive errors.These include common vision problems like nearsightedness (having trouble seeing far away), farsightedness (having trouble seeing things up close), and astigmatism (which can cause blurry vision). Normally, these problems are easy to fix with glasses or contacts. But if they’re not treated, the brain may start to rely more on the eye with stronger vision. Strabismus. Usually, the eyes move together as a pair. But in kids with strabismus, the eyes don’t line up. One eye might drift in, out, up, or down. Cataract.This causes cloudiness in the lens of the eye, making things look blurry. While most cataracts happen in older people, babies and children can also develop cataracts."
How will my child’s doctor check for amblyopia?,"As part of a normalvision screening, your child’s doctor will look for signs of amblyopia. All kids ages 3 to 5 need to have their vision checked at least once."
What’s the treatment for amblyopia?,"If there’s a vision problem causing amblyopia, the doctor may treat that first. For example, doctors may recommend glasses or contacts (for kids who are nearsighted or farsighted) or surgery (for kids with cataract). The next step is to re-train the brain and force it to use the weaker eye. The more the brain uses it, the stronger it gets. Treatments include: Wearing an eye patch on the stronger eye.By covering up this eye with a stick-on eye patch (similar to a Band-Aid), the brain has to use the weaker eye to see. Some kids only need to wear the patch for 2 hours a day, while others may need to wear it whenever they're awake.

Some kids only need to wear the patch for 2 hours a day, while others may need to wear it whenever they're awake. Putting special eye drops in the stronger eye.A once-a-day drop of the drug atropine can temporarily blur near vision, which forces the brain to use the other eye. For some."
What is astigmatism?,Astigmatism is a common eye problem that can make your vision blurry or distorted. It happens when your cornea (the clear front layer of your eye) or lens (an inner part of your eye that helps the eye focus) has a different shape than normal. The only way to find out if you have astigmatism is to get an eye exam. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can help you see better — and some people can get surgery to fix their astigmatism.
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"The most common symptoms of astigmatism are: Blurry vision Needing to squint to see clearly Headaches Eye strain Trouble seeing at night If you have mild astigmatism, you might not notice any symptoms. That’s why it’s important to get regular eye exams — your eye doctor can help you make sure you’re seeing as clearly as possible. This is especially true for children, who may be less likely to realize that their vision isn’t normal."
What causes astigmatism?,"Astigmatism happens when your cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. The shape makes light bend differently as it enters your eye, causing a refractive error. Doctors don’t know what causes astigmatism, and there’s no way to prevent it. Some people are born with astigmatism, but many people develop it as children or young adults. Some people may also develop astigmatism after an eye injury or an eye surgery."
How will my eye doctor check for astigmatism?,Eye doctors can check for astigmatism as part of a dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless.
What's the treatment for astigmatism?,"The most common treatments for astigmatism are eyeglasses orcontact lenses. Your eye doctor will prescribe the right lenses to help you see as clearly as possible. Doctors can also use surgery to treat astigmatism.The surgery changes the shape of your cornea so that it can focus light correctly. If your astigmatism is mild, you may not need treatment. Your eye doctor can help you figure out if you need to get treated, and what type of treatment is best for you.

What are cataracts?,"A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye(theclear part of the eye that helps to focus light). Cataracts are very common as you get older.In fact, more than half of all Americans age 80 or older either have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of cataracts. At first, you may not notice that you have a cataract. But over time, cataracts can make your vision blurry, hazy, or less colorful. You may have trouble reading or doing other everyday activities. Over time, cataracts can lead to vision loss. The good news is that surgery can get rid of cataracts. Cataract surgery is safe and corrects vision problems caused by cataracts."
What are the types of cataracts?,"Most cataracts arerelatedto age— they happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. But you can get cataracts for other reasons —likeafter an eye injury or after surgery for another eye problem (likeglaucoma). No matter what type of cataract you have,you’ll need surgery to treatit."
What are the symptoms of cataracts?,"You might not have any symptoms at first, when cataracts are mild. But as they grow, cataracts can cause changes in your vision. For example, you may notice that: Your vision is cloudy or blurry Colors look faded You can’t see well at night Lamps, sunlight, or headlights seem too bright You see a halo around lights You see double (this sometimes goes away as the cataract gets bigger) You have to change the prescription for your glasses or contact lenses often Talk with your eye doctor if you have any of these symptoms — they could also be signs of other eye problems."
Am I at risk for cataracts?,"Your risk for cataracts goes up as you get older. You’re also at higher risk if you: Have certain health problems, like diabetes Smoke Drink too much alcohol Have a family history of cataracts Have had an eye injury, eye surgery, or radiation treatment on your upper body Have spent a lot of time in the sun Take steroids — medicines used to treat some health problems, like arthritis or allergies If you’re worried you might be at risk for cataracts, talk with your doctor. Ask if there’s anything you can do to lower your risk."
What causes cataracts?,"Most cataracts happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. When you’re young, the lens in your eye is clear. Around age 40, the proteins in the lens of your eye start to break down and clump together. This clump makes a cloudy area on your lens — known as a cataract. Over time, the cataract gets worse and makes more of your lens cloudy."
How can I prevent cataracts?,"You can take steps to protect your eyes from cataracts: Protect your eyes from the sun.Wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block the sun. Protect your eyes from injury.While doing activities like using power tools or playing certain sports, wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from getting accidentally injured. Quit smoking.If you’re ready to quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for free support. Make eye-healthy food choices.Eat plenty of healthy foods — like fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains."
How will my eye doctor check for cataracts?,"An eye doctor can check for cataracts as part of a dilated eye exam. If you’re age 60 or older, get a dilated eye exam every 1 to 2 years. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for cataracts and other eye problems."
What’s the treatment for cataracts?,"Surgery is the only way to get rid of a cataract, but you may not need to get surgery right away. Home treatment.Early on, you may be able to make small changes to manage cataracts. You can do things like:Use brighter lights at home or workWear anti-glare sunglassesUse magnifying lenses for reading and other activities Home treatment.Early on, you may be able to make small changes to manage cataracts.

What are the types of color vision deficiency?,"The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green. Another type makes blue and yellow look the same. In rare cases, people have complete color vision deficiency, which means they don’t see color at all."
What are the symptoms of color vision deficiency?,"The main symptom of color vision deficiency is not seeing colors the way most people do. If you have color vision deficiency, you may have trouble seeing: The difference between colors How bright colors are Different shades of colors Symptoms of color vision deficiency are often so mild that they’re hard to notice. That’s why many people with color vision deficiency don’t know they have it. And people usually adjust to differences in how they see color. People with very serious cases of color vision deficiency might have other symptoms, too — like quick side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) or sensitivity to light."
Am I at risk for color vision deficiency?,"Men have a much higher risk than women for color vision deficiency. You’re also more likely to have color vision deficiency if you: Have a family history of color vision deficiency Have certain eye diseases Have certain health problems, like diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or multiple sclerosis (MS) Take certain medicines Are white If you think you may have color vision deficiency, talk with your eye doctor about getting checked. It can be tricky to diagnose color vision deficiency in children. Kids who have color vision deficiency may try to hide it. But having color vision deficiency can make it hard to read from a chalkboard or do other activities, so get your child’s eyes tested if you’re concerned. Get your child’s eyes tested if they have a family history of color vision deficiency or if they seem to be having trouble learning colors. Ask your child’s eye doctor to test them. You also may be able to get your child’s eyes tested at school."
What causes color vision deficiency?,"Most people who have color vision deficiency are born with it. This is because the most common types of color vision deficiency are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parents. Color vision deficiency can also happen because of an injury to the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye), the optic nerve (which connects the eye to the brain), or the brain itself.Some examples of injuries that can lead to color vision deficiency are: Retinal detachment(when the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of the eye) Eye injuries caused by lasers Some kinds of brain tumors — especially ones that affect the optic nerve or put pressure on the brain Radiation treatments Color vision may also get worse as you get older — often because ofcataracts(cloudy areas in the lens of the eye)."
What's the treatment for color vision deficiency?,"There’s no cure for color vision deficiency that’s passed down in families (inherited), but most people adjust to it. Children with color vision deficiency may need help with some classroom activities, and adults with color vision deficiency may need accommodations to do jobs that rely on telling the difference between colors,like being a graphic designer. If your color vision deficiency is happening because of another health problem, your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing the problem. If you’re taking a medicine that causes color vision deficiency, your doctor may adjust how much you take or suggest you switch to a different medicine. If color vision deficiency is causing problems with everyday tasks, talk with your eye doctor about available options, like: Glasses and contacts.Special contact lenses and eyeglasses may help people who have color vision deficiency tell the difference between colors. They work by increasing the contrast between colors so they’re easier to tell apart.

What is the cornea?,The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eye.Thecornea helps your eye to focus light so you can see clearly.
What are the main types of corneal conditions?,"There are several common conditions that affect thecornea. Injuries. Small abrasions (scratches) on the cornea usually heal on their own. Deeper scratches or other injuries can cause corneal scarring and vision problems. Allergies. Allergies to pollen can irritate the eyes and cause allergic conjunctivitis (pink eye). This can make your eyes red, itchy, and watery. Keratitis. Keratitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the cornea. Infections related to contact lenses are the most common cause of keratitis. Dry eye. Dry eye happens when your eyes don’t make enough tears to stay wet. This can be uncomfortable and may cause vision problems. Corneal dystrophies. Corneal dystrophies cause cloudy vision when material builds up on the cornea. These diseases usually run in families. There are also a number of less common diseases that can affect the cornea — including ocular herpes, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, and pterygium. Go to the eye doctor or the emergency room if you have: Intense eye pain Change in vision Blurry vision Very red, watery eyes An object stuck in your eye A serious eye injury or trauma — like getting hit hard in the eye"
Am I at risk for corneal conditions?,"Some corneal conditions, like corneal dystrophies, run in families. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk of corneal injuries and infections. Toprevent corneal injuries,wear protective eyewear when you: Play sports that use a ball or puck, like baseball or hockey Do yardwork, like mowing the lawn or using a weedwhacker Make repairs, like painting or hammering Use machines, like sanders or drills Use chemicals, like bleach or pesticides If you wear contact lenses, always follow the instructions to clean, disinfect, and store your lenses. This can help prevent corneal infections, like keratitis."
Feel like something’s stuck in your eye?,"Try blinking several times Try rinsing your eye with clean water or saline (salt) solution Try pulling your upper eyelid down over your lower eyelid Don’t rub your eye — you could scratch your cornea If an object is stuck in your eye, don’t try to remove it yourself — go to your eye doctor or the emergency room"
How will my eye doctor check for corneal conditions?,"Eye doctors can check for corneal conditions as part of a comprehensiveeye exam. The exam is simple and painless. To check for corneal abrasions (scratches), your eye doctor may use a special type of eye drops called fluorescein dye. The dye makes corneal abrasions easier to see."
What is the treatment for corneal conditions?,"Many corneal conditions can be treated with prescription eye drops or pills. If you have advanced corneal disease, you may need a different treatment. Laser treatment.To treat some corneal dystrophies and other conditions, doctors can use a type of laser treatment called phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) to reshape the cornea, remove scar tissue, and make vision clearer.

What is diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). If you have diabetes, it’s important to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first — but finding it early can help you take steps to protect your vision. Managing your diabetes — by staying physically active, eating healthy, and taking your medicine — can also help you prevent or delay vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss for people with diabetes. But diabetes can also make you more likely to develop several other eye conditions: Cataracts.Having diabetes makes you 2 to 5 times more likely to develop cataracts. It also makes you more likely to get them at a younger age.Learn more about cataracts. Open-angle glaucoma.Having diabetes nearly doubles your risk of developing a type of glaucoma called open-angle glaucoma.Learn more about glaucoma."
What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?,"The early stages of diabetic retinopathy usually don’t have any symptoms. Some people notice changes in their vision, like trouble reading or seeing faraway objects. These changes may come and go. In later stages of the disease, blood vessels in the retina start to bleed into the vitreous (gel-like fluid that fills your eye). If this happens, you may see dark, floating spots or streaks that look like cobwebs. Sometimes, the spots clear up on their own — but it’s important to get treatment right away. Without treatment, scars can form in the back of the eye. Blood vessels may also start to bleed again, or the bleeding may get worse."
What other problems can diabetic retinopathy cause?,"Diabetic retinopathy can lead to other serious eye conditions: Diabetic macular edema (DME).Over time, about 1 in 15 people with diabeteswill develop DME. DME happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This causes blurry vision. Neovascular glaucoma.Diabetic retinopathy can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow out of the retina and block fluid from draining out of the eye. This causes a type of glaucoma (a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness). Retinal detachment.Diabetic retinopathy can cause scars to form in the back of your eye. When the scars pull your retina away from the back of your eye, it’s called tractional retinal detachment."
Am I at risk for diabetic retinopathy?,"Anyone with any kind of diabetes can get diabetic retinopathy — including people with type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy). Your risk increases the longer you have diabetes.Over time, more than half of people with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy.The good news is that you can lower your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy by controlling your diabetes. Women with diabetes who become pregnant — or women who develop gestational diabetes — are at high risk for getting diabetic retinopathy. If you have diabetes and are pregnant, have a comprehensive dilated eye exam as soon as possible. Ask your doctor if you’ll need additional eye exams during your pregnancy."
What causes diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar due to diabetes. Over time, having too much sugar in your blood can damage your retina — the part of your eye that detects light and sends signals to your brain through a nerve in the back of your eye (optic nerve). Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The damage to your eyes starts when the sugar in your blood causes changes to the tiny blood vessels that go to your retina. These changes make it harder for the blood to flow, leading to blocked blood vessels that leak fluid or bleed. To make up for these blocked blood vessels, your eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. These new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily."
How will my eye doctor check for diabetic retinopathy?,"Eye doctors can check for diabetic retinopathy as part of a dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for diabetic retinopathy and other eye problems. If you have diabetes, it’s very important to get regular eye exams. If you do develop diabetic retinopathy, early treatment can stop the damage and prevent blindness. If your eye doctor thinks you may have severe diabetic retinopathy or DME, they may do a test called a fluorescein angiogram. This test lets the doctor see pictures of the blood vessels in your retina."
What can I do to prevent diabetic retinopathy?,"Managing your diabetes is the best way to lower your risk of diabetic retinopathy. That means keeping your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. You can do this by getting regular physical activity, eating healthy, and carefully following yourdoctor’sinstructions for your insulin or other diabetes medicines. To make sure your diabetes treatment plan is working, you’ll need a special lab test called an A1C test. This test shows your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months. You can work with your doctor to set a personal A1C goal. Meeting your A1C goal can help prevent or manage diabetic retinopathy. Having high blood pressure or high cholesterol along with diabetes increases your risk for diabetic retinopathy. So controlling your blood pressure and cholesterol can also help lower your risk for visionloss."
What’s the treatment for diabetic retinopathy and DME?,"In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, your eye doctor will probably just keep track of how your eyes are doing. Some people with diabetic retinopathy may need a comprehensive dilated eye exam as often as every 2 to 4 months. In later stages, it’s important to start treatment right away — especially if you have changes in your vision. While it won’t undo any damage to your vision, treatment can stop your vision from getting worse. It’s also important to take steps to control your diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

What is dry eye?,"Dry eye happens when your eyes don’t make enough tears to stay wet, or when your tears don’t work correctly. This can make your eyes feel uncomfortable, and in some cases it can also cause vision problems. Dry eye is common — it affects millions of Americans every year. The good news is that if you have dry eye, there are lots of things you can do to keep your eyes healthy and stay comfortable."
What are the symptoms of dry eye?,"Dry eye can cause: A scratchy feeling, like there’s something in your eye Stinging or burning feelings in your eye Red eyes Sensitivity to light Blurry vision"
Am I at risk for dry eye?,"Anyone can get dry eye, but you might be more likely to have dry eye if you: Are age 50 or older Are female Wear contact lenses Don’t get enough vitamin A (found in foods like carrots, broccoli, and liver) or omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, walnuts, and vegetableoils) Have certain autoimmune conditions, like lupus or Sjögren syndrome"
What causes dry eye?,"Normally, glands above your eyes make tears that keep your eyes wet. Dry eye happens when your tears don’t do their job. This could mean: Your glands don’t make enough tears to keep your eyes wet Your tears dry up too fast Your tears just don’t work well enough to keep your eyes wet"
How will my eye doctor check for dry eye?,"Your doctor can check for dry eye as part of acomprehensive dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for dry eye and other eye problems.  Be sure to tell your doctor if you think you might have dry eye. To find out if you have dry eye, your doctor might check: The amount of tears your eyes make How long it takes for your tears to dry up The structure of your eyelids"
What’s the treatment for dry eye?,"Treatment for dry eye usually depends on what’s causing your symptoms. There are a few different types of treatment that can ease your symptoms and help keep your eyes healthy. Over-the-counter eye drops.The most common treatment for mild dry eye is a type of eye drops called artificial tears. You can get these eye drops without a prescription.

What are floaters?,"Floaters are small dark shapes that float across your vision. They can look like spots, threads, squiggly lines, or even little cobwebs. Most people have floaters that come and go, and they often don’t need treatment. But sometimes floaters can be a sign of a more serious eye condition. So if you notice new floaters that appear suddenly and don’t go away, it’s important to tell your eye doctor."
What are the symptoms of floaters?,"Floaters move as your eyes move — so when you try to look at them directly, they seem to move away. When your eyes stop moving, floaters keep drifting across your vision. You may notice floaters more when you look at something bright, like white paper or a blue sky."
Am I at risk for floaters?,"Almost everyone develops floaters as they get older, but some people are at higher risk. You’re at higher risk if you: Are very nearsighted Have diabetes Have had surgery to treat cataracts"
What causes floaters?,"Floaters usually happen because of normal changes in your eyes. As you age, tiny strands of your vitreous (the gel-like fluid that fills your eye) stick together and cast shadows on your retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). Those shadows appear as floaters. Sometimes floaters have more serious causes, including: Eye infections Eye injuries Uveitis(inflammation in the eye) Bleeding in the eye Vitreous detachment(when the vitreous pulls away from the retina) Retinal tear (when vitreous detachment tears a hole in the retina) Retinal detachment(when the retina gets pulled away from the back of the eye) Sometimes new floaters can be a sign of a retinal tear or retinal detachment — when the retina gets torn or pulled from its normal position at the back of the eye. Symptoms can include: A lot of new floaters that appear suddenly, sometimes with flashes of light A dark shadow (like a curtain) or blurry area in your side or central vision Retinal tear or detachment can be a medical emergency. If you have these symptoms, it’s important to go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away."
How will my eye doctor check for floaters?,"Your eye doctor can check for floaters as part of a dilated eye exam. Your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for floaters and other eye problems. This exam is usually painless. The doctor may press on your eyelids to check for retinal tears, which may be uncomfortable for some people."
What’s the treatment for floaters?,"Treatment for floaters depends on the cause. If your floaters are caused by another eye condition, you may need treatment for that condition. If your floaters are caused by aging and they don’t bother you, then you probably won’t need any treatment. If your floaters make it hard to see clearly and interfere with your daily life, your eye doctor might suggest a surgery called a vitrectomy to remove the floaters. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of this surgery.

What are the types of glaucoma?,"There are many different types of glaucoma, but the most common type in the United States is calledopen-angle glaucoma— that’s what most people mean when they talk about glaucoma. Other types are less common, like angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma."
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"At first, glaucoma doesn’t usually have any symptoms. That’s why half of people with glaucoma don’t even know they have it. Over time, you may slowly lose vision, usually starting with your side (peripheral) vision — especially the part of your vision that’s closest to your nose. Because it happens so slowly, many people can’t tell that their vision is changing at first. But as the disease gets worse, you may start to notice that you can’t see things off to the side anymore. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually cause blindness."

Angle-closure glaucoma can cause these sudden symptoms: Intense eye pain Upset stomach (nausea) Red eye Blurry vision If you have any of these symptoms, go to your doctor or an emergency room now."
What causes glaucoma?,"Scientists aren’t sure what causes the most common types of glaucoma, but many people with glaucoma have high eye pressure — and treatments that lower eye pressure help to slow the disease. There’s no way to prevent glaucoma. That’s why eye exams are so important — so you and your doctor can find it before it affects your vision."

What Is Keratoconus?,"Yourcorneais the clear, dome-shaped window at the front of your eye. It focuses light into your eye. Keratoconus is when the cornea thins out and bulges like a cone. Changing the shape of the cornea brings light rays out of focus. As a result, your vision is blurry and distorted, making daily tasks like reading ordrivingdifficult.What Causes Keratoconus?Doctors do not know for sure why people have keratoconus. In some cases, it appears to be genetic (passed down in families). About 1 out of 10 people with keratoconus have a parent who has it too. Keratoconus is also associated with:eye allergiesexcessive eye rubbing, andconnective tissue disorders likeMarfan syndromeand Ehlers-Danlos syndromeKeratoconus SymptomsKeratoconus often starts when people are in their late teens to early 20s.

What is pink eye?,"Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, causes swelling and redness in the inside of your eyelid and the white part of your eye. Your eye may also feel itchy and painful. Pink eye is common, and some types of pink eye spread very easily. You can keep from spreading it to other people by washing your hands often and not sharing items like pillowcases, towels, or makeup. Some types of pink eye get better on their own. If your case is mild, you can ease your symptoms at home using a cold compress and eye drops you can get over the counter, meaning without a prescription. Other types of pink eye may need treatment from a doctor. Pink eye can cause serious health problems for newborn babies. Call a doctor now if your baby has: Unusual fluid (discharge) coming from the eye Puffy red eyelids"
What are the symptoms of pink eye?,"The most common symptoms of pink eye are: Pink or red eyes Itchy or burning eyes Watery eyes White, yellow, or green fluid (discharge) coming from your eyes Crust along your eyelids or eyelashes, which may keep your eyes from opening when you wake up Pink eye may also cause: Swollen eyelids A feeling like something’s stuck in your eye Sensitivity to bright light Blurry vision A lump in front of your ear If you wear contact lenses, you may notice that they feel uncomfortable or don’t stay in place."
Am I at risk for pink eye?,"Anyone can get pink eye. It’s one of the most common eye problems for both children and adults. You’re more likely to get pink eye if you: Come in contact with someone else who has pink eye Recently had a respiratory infection, like a cough or a cold Wear contact lenses Come in contact with something you’re allergic to Newborn babies are also at higher risk for pink eye — and it can be very serious."
What causes pink eye?,"Most of the time, pink eye is caused by a virus or bacteria. Viral pink eye is the most common type. You can also get pink eye from allergies to things like pollen or pet fur — or from other things that can bother your eyes, like pool water with chlorine, air pollution, or makeup. It can be hard to figure out the exact cause of pink eye, because the symptoms are usually the same."
How can I prevent pink eye from spreading?,"Viral and bacterial pink eye spread very easily from person to person — but you can take steps to keep pink eye from spreading. If you’re around someone who has pink eye: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you don’t have soap and water, you can use hand sanitizer with alcohol in it. Wash your hands after you touch the person with pink eye or something that person used — for example, if you help put eye drops in their eyes, or put their bed sheets in the washing machine. Always wash your hands before touching your eyes. Don’t share personal items that the person with pink eye has used — including pillows, towels, makeup, or glasses. If you have pink eye: Wash your hands often with soap and water. Be extra careful about washing them after you touch your eyes or use eye drops or medicine. If you don’t have soap and water, you can use hand sanitizer with alcohol in it. Avoid touching or rubbing your eyes. If you have discharge, wash the area around your eyes 2 or 3 times a day. Use a clean, wet washcloth or a fresh cotton ball each time.."
What is presbyopia?,Presbyopia is a refractive error that makes it hard for middle-aged and older adults to see things up close. It happens because the lens (an inner part of the eye that helps the eye focus) stops focusing light correctly on the retina (a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). Presbyopia is a normal part of aging. Everyone gets presbyopia as they get older — usually after age 45. Many people have another refractive error in addition to presbyopia.
What are the symptoms of presbyopia?,"Symptoms of presbyopia include: Trouble seeing things up close Needing to hold reading materials farther away to focus on them Eye strain (when your eyes feel tired or sore) Headache Presbyopia gets worse over time, but it usually stops getting worse after age 65."
What causes presbyopia?,"As you age, the lens in your eye gets harder and less flexible, and it stops focusing light correctly on the retina. This makes nearby objects look blurry. Presbyopia is different than farsightedness — another refractive error that makes it hard to see things up close.Learn more about farsightedness."
How will my eye doctor check for presbyopia?,Eye doctors can check for presbyopia as part of a comprehensive eye exam. The exam is simple and painless.
What’s the treatment for presbyopia?,"In early stages of presbyopia, you can try some simple changes to help you read, like: Holding reading materials farther away Choosing large-print books or increasing font size on the computer Using brighter reading lights As your presbyopia gets worse, you’ll probably need glasses or contact lenses to help you read. Some people use over-the-counter reading glasses — or your eye doctor can prescribe lenses to help you see as clearly as possible.

How will my eye doctor check for refractive errors?,"Eye doctors can check for refractive errors as part of a comprehensive eye exam. The exam is simple and painless. Your doctor will ask you to read letters that are up close and far away. Then, they may give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and check for other eye problems."
What are the stages of ROP?,"There are 5 different stages of ROP. Doctors use these stages to keep track of how serious ROP is. The stages range from stage 1 (mild) to stage 5 (severe): Stages 1 and 2— Babies in these stages usually get better without treatment and go on to have healthy vision. Doctors will watch babies carefully to see if their ROP gets worse. Stage 3— Some babies who develop stage 3 get better with no treatment and go on to have healthy vision. But others need treatment to stop abnormal blood vessels from damaging the retina and causing retinal detachment (an eye problem that can cause vision loss). Stage 4— Babies in stage 4 have partially detached retinas and need treatment. Stage 5— In stage 5, the retina detaches completely. Even with treatment, babies in stage 5 may have vision loss or blindness. Both stages 4 and 5 are very serious. Babies in these stages often need surgery — but even with treatment, they may have vision loss. That’s why doctors usually start treatment in stage 3. It’s also possible for babies in any stage to get worse quickly and need treatment. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your."
What is retinal detachment?,Retinal detachment is an eye problem that happens when your retina (a light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye) is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.
What are the symptoms of retinal detachment?,"If only a small part of your retina has detached, you may not have any symptoms. But if more of your retina is detached, you may not be able to see as clearly as normal, and you may notice other sudden symptoms, including: A lot of new floaters (small dark spots or squiggly lines that float across your vision) Flashes of light in one eye or both eyes A dark shadow or “curtain” on the sides or in the middle of your field of vision Retinal detachment is a medical emergency.If you have symptoms of a detached retina, it’s important to go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away. The symptoms of retinal detachment often come on quickly. If the retinal detachment isn’t treated right away, more of the retina can detach — which increases the risk of permanent vision loss or blindness."
Am I at risk for retinal detachment?,"Anyone can have a retinal detachment, but some people are at higher risk. You are at higher risk if: You or a family member has had a retinal detachment before You’ve had a serious eye injury You’ve had eye surgery, like surgery to treat cataracts Some other problems with your eyes may also put you at higher risk, including: Diabetic retinopathy (a condition in people with diabetes that affects blood vessels in the retina) Extreme nearsightedness (myopia), especially a severe type called degenerative myopia Posterior vitreous detachment (when the gel-like fluid in the center of the eye pulls away from the retina) Certain other eye diseases, including retinoschisis (when the retina separates into 2 layers) or lattice degeneration (thinning of the retina) If you’re concerned about your risk for retinal detachment, talk with your eye doctor."
What causes retinal detachment?,"There are many causes of retinal detachment, but the most common causes are aging or an eye injury. There are 3 types of retinal detachment: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative. Each type happens because of a different problem that causes your retina to move away from the back of your eye."
How can I prevent retinal detachment?,"Since retinal detachment is often caused by aging, there’s often no way to prevent it. But you can lower your risk of retinal detachment from an eye injury by wearing safety goggles or other protective eye gear when doing risky activities, like playing sports. If you experience any symptoms of retinal detachment, go to your eye doctor or the emergency room right away. Early treatment can help prevent permanent vision loss. It’s also important to get comprehensive dilated eye exams regularly. A dilated eye exam can help your eye doctor find a small retinal tear or detachment early, before it starts to affect your vision."
How will my eye doctor check for retinal detachment?,"If you see any warning signs of a retinal detachment, your eye doctor can check your eyes with a dilated eye exam. Your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then look at your retina at the back of your eye. This exam is usually painless. The doctor may press on your eyelids to check for retinal tears, which may be uncomfortable for some people. If your eye doctor still needs more information after a dilated eye exam, you may get an ultrasound or an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of your eye. Both of these tests are painless and can help your eye doctor see the exact position of your retina."
What’s the treatment for retinal detachment?,"Depending on how much of your retina is detached and what type of retinal detachment you have, your eye doctor may recommend laser surgery, freezing treatment, or other types of surgery to fix any tears or breaks in your retina and reattach your retina to the back of your eye. Sometimes, your eye doctor will use more than one of these treatments at the same time. Freeze treatment (cryopexy) or laser surgery.If you have a small hole or tear in your retina, your doctor can use a freezing probe or a medical laser to seal any tears or breaks in your retina. You can usually get these treatments in the eye doctor’s office.Learn more about laser surgery and freezing treatment Freeze treatment (cryopexy) or laser surgery.If you have a small hole or tear in your retina, your doctor can use a freezing probe or a medical laser to seal any tears or breaks in your retina.

What Is Adult Strabismus?,"Adult strabismus (crossed eyes) is when your eyes are not lined up properly and they point in different directions. One eye may look straight ahead while the other eye turns in, out, up, or down. The misalignment can shift from one eye to the other.Strabismus affects vision, since both eyes must aim at the same spot together to see properly.There Are Six Eye Muscles That Control Eye MovementOne muscle moves the eye to the right, and one muscle moves the eye to the left. The other four muscles move the eye up, down, and at an angle. In order to focus on a single image, all six eye muscles must work together.What Causes Adult Strabismus (Crossed Eyes)?To line up and focus both eyes on a single target, all muscles in both eyes must be balanced and working together. The brain controls these muscles. People who have strabismus usually have a problem that can affect eye muscles. Some of those problems may include:Health problems such asdiabetes,thyroid eye disease(or TED, also known as Graves’ eye disease), Myasthenia gravis, brain tumors, or a strokeAccidents or head injuryDamage to eye muscles during some kind of eye surgeryMost adults with strabismus have had it since."
What Is an After-Cataract?,"After cataract surgery, your vision can become cloudy due to what is known as an after-cataract. In this condition, the posterior capsule, which holds the lens in place, becomes cloudy and may blur your vision. An after-cataract can develop months or even years after surgery. An after-cataract is treated by a technique called YAG laser capsulotomy. Your doctor uses a laser beam to create a tiny hole in the posterior capsule to let light pass through. This is a painless outpatient procedure.

What is Eye Cancer?,"Any cancer that starts in or around the eye is called eye cancer. Cancer starts when cells mutate. Ocular oncologists specialize in treating eye cancer. Different types of cancer start in different parts of the eye. Your eye has three main parts: the eyeball; the orbit, tissues surrounding the eye; and structures such as the eyelids and tear glands. Here are some examples of eye cancers: Intraocular cancers:Uveal melanomaLymphoma Uveal melanoma Lymphoma Retinoblastoma, the most common eye cancer in children Cancers on the surface of the eye Metastatic cancers Benign tumors Blurry vision or sudden loss of vision Floaters in your eye (spots or squiggles that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light A growing dark spot on your iris, the colored part of the eye Pupil changes in size or shape Eyeball changes position within its socket Bulging eyeballs These symptoms may not be due to cancer. They could be from a different condition. A physician can evaluate these symptoms. Patients with eye cancer rarely feel pain, unless the tumor has grown outside the eyeball.

What Is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the part of your eye that carries information defining what you see to your brain. Your brain then turns the information into images. Though there are probably several factors that contribute to glaucoma, the one we understand the best is eye pressure. With glaucoma, fluid builds up in your eye and increases pressure. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve over time. Without treatment, optic nerve damage can cause vision loss and eventual blindness. Around 3 million people in the United States have glaucoma. The disease mostly affects adults, but glaucoma can occur in people of any age. Glaucoma is hereditary (tends to run in families). You should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist for glaucoma screening if you have a family member with glaucoma. Acataractis a disease affecting your lens, the clear curved structure at the front of your eye behind your pupil. Glaucoma affects your optic nerve. Both cataracts and glaucoma can cause vision problems. Cataracts tend to affect your general, overall vision, while glaucoma affects your outer (peripheral) vision first then moves inward.."
Am I a Candidate for LASIK?,"LASIK is a medical procedure that improves your vision by using a laser.

What Is Uveitis?,"Uveitis is a condition that occurs in the uvea, or the middle area of the eye. Because the uvea contains the blood vessels that supply nutrients to the eye, any form of uveitis may be serious and may be a symptom of other serious conditions. There are three types of uveitis: Anterior uveitisis the most common form of uveitis. It affects the iris and ciliary body and may be associated with autoimmune disorders such as various types of arthritis. Iritis may develop suddenly and may last up to eight weeks, even with treatment, or may have a chronic course, requiring prolonged treatment. Intermediate uveitisis an inflammation of the middle portion of the eye, the vitreous gel, and the retina. This may develop suddenly and last several months or have a chronic, indolent course. Posterior uveitisaffects the back of the eye and involves the retina, choroid, or both. It may progress quickly, making it difficult to treat. Retinitis may be caused by viruses, such as shingles or herpes simplex virus, and bacterial infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis. Choroiditis is an inflammation of the layer beneath the retina. It may also be caused by an infection, such as tuberculosis. Retinitis and."
WHAT ARE CATARACTS?,"Cataract Surgery Understanding Cataracts Femtosecond Laser Intraocular Lens Treatment A cataract is a thickening and hardening of the lens in the eye. As the lens in your eye thickens, the naturally transparent lens becomes clouded or opaque. In its early stages, a cataract may not cause a problem; the cloudiness may affect only a small part of the lens. However, as the cataract grows larger it prevents light from reaching your retina. As less light reaches your retina, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and vision may become dull and blurry. Cataract surgeryis one of the best ways to treat advanced cataracts. A cataract, a clouding of the natural lens of the eye, blurs vision and can eventually lead to blindness. To improve your vision with cataract surgery, your doctor removes the clouded lens and inserts a clear artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, or IOL, in its place. Cataracts don’t return, so cataract surgery can improve the quality of your vision for years to come. The Moran Eye Center offers the most advanced laser cataract surgery available and our cataract surgery team is dedicated to excellence in both the consultation and treatment of all types of cataracts.

What Causes Corneal Infections?,"Corneal infections can be caused by many things. Sometimes the cornea is damaged after a foreign object has penetrated the tissue, maybe from a poke in the eye. Bacteria or fungi from a contaminated contact lens can also pass into the cornea. These things can cause painful inflammation and corneal infections called keratitis. Keratitis can reduce visual clarity, produce corneal discharges, and possibly erode the cornea. Corneal infections can also lead to corneal scarring, which can impair vision and may require a corneal transplant. As a general rule, the deeper the corneal infection, the more severe the symptoms and complications. Most corneal infections, however, generally happen to individuals that wearcontact lenses. View Video Minor corneal infections are commonly treated with anti-bacterial eye drops. If the problem is severe, your doctor may proscribe intensive antibiotic or anti-fungal treatment for the infection as well as steroid eye drops to reduce inflammation. Frequent visits to an eye care professional may be necessary for several months to eliminate the problem.

How Long Does Dry Eye Last?,"Dry eye is a chronic condition that will only go away with medication or removal of environmental factors (e.g., reduction of screen time, increased moisture in the air, etc.) Daily treatment may be needed to help ease your dry eye symptoms. You should begin using over-the-counter artificial tears or other recommended home remedies as soon as symptoms occur. Talk with your ophthalmologist if your dry eye does not improve with home care after one to two weeks. See one of our ophthalmologists if you've had signs and symptoms of dry eyes, including red, irritated, tired, or painful eyes for longer than two weeks. Your ophthalmologist will conduct an eye exam and evaluate your symptoms to help determine if more advanced treatment is necessary. Our eye care specialists recommend beginning treatment at home to see if your symptoms improve. Dry eyes may be caused by a variety or combination of factors that interfere with healthy tear film. Your eye’s tear film is made up of three layers: fatty oils, water, and mucus. This combination normally keeps the surface of your eyes naturally moisturized. An imbalance within these layers cause dry eyes. Specific causes may include: cell phone, computer, tablet, or TV."
How Common Are Eye Allergies?,"Allergies affecting the eye are fairly common. The most common allergies are those related to pollen, particularly when the weather is warm and dry. Symptoms can include the following: Redness Itching Tearing Burning Stinging Watery discharge These symptoms, though irritating, are not usually severe enough to need medical attention. Antihistamine decongestant eye drops can reduce these symptoms, as does rain and cooler weather, which decreases the amount of pollen in the air. An increasing number of eye allergy cases are related to medications and contact lens wear. Also, animal hair and certain cosmetics, such as mascara, face creams, and eyebrow pencil, can cause allergies that affect the eye. Touching or rubbing eyes after handling nail polish, soaps, or chemicals may cause an allergic reaction. Some people have sensitivity to lip gloss and eye makeup. Allergy symptoms are temporary and can eliminated by not having contact with the cosmetic or detergent that causes it.

What Bacteria Causes Pink Eye?,"Pink eye is usually a viral infection (viral conjunctivitis) caused by a cold virus. However, pink eye from bacteria (bacterial conjunctivitis) is most commonly caused by exposure to staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria from your own skin or respiratory system. Your ophthalmologist will conduct an exam to determine the type of pink eye you have and recommend proper treatment. Allergic conjunctivitis (allergy-related pink eye) is common among people who suffer from allergic reactions to: pollen, animal dander, dust, chemicals, makeup, contact lens solution, or eye drops. Allergic conjunctivitis may be accompanied by watery discharge from the eye. Unlike viral and bacterial pink conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious and always affects both eyes. Your conjunctivitis symptoms may vary depending on the cause and severity, such as sticky matting or crusting over your eye after waking; feeling like something is in your eye; or intense itching due to allergies."
Does Pink Eye Hurt?,"Conjunctivitis is not usually painful, however, your eye or eyes may feel sore or uncomfortable. If you experience intense pain, see your ophthalmologist right away."
What Does Pink Eye Look Like?,"Conjunctivitis appears as increased redness (pink) in the white part of the eye. Visible clear, watery, or mucus-like discharge may also be present. Other visible marks or discoloration in your eyes may be a sign of more serious disease and should be examined as soon as possible."
Is Pink Eye Contagious?,"Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts in one eye then spreads to the other. Avoid spreading pink eye by practicing good hygiene such as washing hands, disinfecting high-touch surfaces (e.g. doorknobs or countertops), and not sharing personal items, such as utensils, clothes, or towels."
How Long Is Pink Eye Contagious?,"Conjunctivitis is contagious while the eye is red (typically five to seven days). It is no longer contagious once redness or other symptoms have resolved. If your symptoms are mild, you may try home treatment or visit with your primary care physician. If your symptoms do not improve in one to two weeks, we recommend seeing one of our ophthalmologists. If symptoms are severe, see an ophthalmologist within one to two days. Our ophthalmologists will evaluate your symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and recommend proper treatment. We may also suggest further testing to determine the type of pink eye you have or rule out other diseases of the eye. Conjunctivitis is usually painless and does not affect vision. See an eye care specialist immediately if you experience intense pain, light sensitivity, or decrease in vision. Treatment for conjunctivitis focuses on relieving uncomfortable symptoms. Your treatment may vary depending on the type of conjunctivitis you have. One of our ophthalmologists may recommend: using artificial tears; applying cold or warm compresses (wet or dry) to your eye several times a day; taking a break from wearing contact lenses; antibiotics for bacterial pink eye (e.g. eye drops, oral medication, or cream); or antihistamines or."
What Is a Stye?,"A stye is a red, painful, pimple-like bump that forms on the eyelid or eyelash line. When one of the oil glands at the edge of your eyelid becomes infected, a stye may develop on the inside or outside of the eyelid. Styes can happen at any age from newborns to older adults."

Try to avoid scratching your stye, as that may damage your skin or the soft tissue of your eye."
How Do You Get a Stye?,"Styes are caused by a clogged or infected oil gland in your eyelid. You may be at increased risk for a stye if you: experience blepharitis (chronic eyelid inflammation); have skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis; have diabetes; are going through hormonal changes; or have increased lipid levels associated with high cholesterol."
Are Eye Styes Caused by Stress?,"Styes are not caused by stress, diet, or hygiene."
Why Do I Keep Getting Styes?,Recurrent styes may be due to chronic conditions such as blepharitis (clogged oil ducts) or rosacea. Your ophthalmologist can help determine any underlying causes and recommend the correct treatment.
Are Styes Contagious?,"Styes are not contagious. However, in rare instances, bacteria may spread between others if common items like towels or pillowcases are shared. If your symptoms are mild, you may try home treatment, or visit your primary care physician. See one of our ophthalmologists within one week if your stye has worsened or symptoms become severe. If symptoms are severe, see an ophthalmologist within one to two days. Your ophthalmologist will conduct an eye exam and evaluate your symptoms to determine if more advanced treatment is necessary. See an ophthalmologist right away if: your eye swells shut, your pain or swelling increases after two to three days, blisters form on your eyelid, your eyelid feels hot, or you experience substantial changes in vision. Styes frequently recur. Your ophthalmologist may recommend a small biopsy (tissue sample) of the stye to rule out underlying medical conditions.  If you frequently develop styes, your ophthalmologist may prescribe an antibiotic to further treat and prevent recurrences. In severe or long-lasting (over three weeks) cases, your ophthalmologist may also recommend an in-office procedure to drain your stye. Our clinicians are trained to properly drain a stye without damaging your eye or surrounding tissue."
How Long Does a Stye Last?,"Many styes heal within a few days and can be easily treated at home. See your eye care specialist if your stye lasts more than two to three weeks. Our eye care specialists recommend beginning treatment at home to see if your symptoms improve before seeking professional care. Try applying warm compresses to the stye. Hold a clean cloth under warm water until it’s completely wet. Wring out excess water, fold the cloth into a rectangle, and apply to the affected eyelid. When the cloth is no longer warm, repeat the process and reapply to your eye. You may repeat this process for 15 minutes four times a day over the course of several days. When heat is applied, it brings the stye to a head like a pimple, allowing the tense fluid inside to drain and relieve any associated pain."
Can You Pop a Stye When It Comes to a Head?,"We do not recommend trying to pop or drain a stye on your own. Improperly popping a stye can lead to further infection or inflammation. Apply a warm compress once a day. Remove your eye makeup before going to bed. Replace your eye makeup regularly to avoid bacterial growth. Wash your hands before touching your eyes or contact lenses. Avoid sharing makeup, towels, pillows, or other personal items. If you regularly experience styes, your ophthalmologist may recommend an antibiotic ointment to apply daily. If you have a stye, or have other eye care concerns, contact ourOphthalmology Clinicat 801-581-2352 to schedule an appointment. Referrals are welcome, but not necessary.

What Is Electrophysiology?,"Electrophysiology is used to diagnose and follow progression of disorders affecting vision similar to the manner electrocardiograms (ECGs) are used to monitor heart disease. The retina of the eye, optic pathways in the brain and visual cortex create electrical signals that can be recorded directly from the eye or extracted by computer from brain electrical signals recorded from the scalp, similar to recording electroencephalograms (EEG). Moran Eye Center electrophysiologists are leaders in the field and are actively involved in research to improve electrophysiological testing. Learn more about electrophysiological testing: Electroretinograms Multifocal electroretinograms Visually evoked potentials Multifocal visually evoked potentials Electro-oculograms Auditory brainstem responses Dark adaptometry Saccadic velocities The electroretinogram (ERG) is an electrical response of the retina to photic stimulation. The ERG is similar to an electrocardiogram in that it shows the electrical health of the retina, similar to the ECG reflecting the health of the heart muscles. The eye does not beat, so the retina must be stimulated to start its electrical response. A flash of light or bright appearance of a pattern sparks a biphasic negative/positive waveform. Chemical changes in the retina start in 18 nanoseconds. The a-wave is the initial electrochemical discharge of the rods (night receptors)."
Are There Different Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Not all glaucoma cases are the same. There are actually several types of glaucoma, and your treatment will depend on what type of glaucoma you have. A small percentage of people with glaucoma have a condition known as narrow-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma can occur slowly and progressively or very quickly and can only be detected through an eye exam. Narrow-angle glaucoma usually occurs in far-sighted people because they tend to have anterior chambers that are smaller than normal. In cases of narrow-angle glaucoma, the iris can bow forward, thinning the angle that normally drains the eye. As the angle becomes smaller, fluid backs up and pressure in the eye, or intraocular pressure, begins to rise. If narrow-angle glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause loss of vision. In some cases, narrow-angle glaucoma can lead to an emergency condition known as angle-closure glaucoma. For more information, ask your doctor about narrow angle glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of adult glaucoma and can lead to loss of vision or blindness. This type of glaucoma can only be detected by your eye care practitioner through a routine."
What Are Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments?,"Since the procedure is used to flatten a steep cornea, nearsighted patients benefit the most. The level of nearsightedness should be mild, and the patients should have little or no astigmatism. The advantage of this procedure is that the ring segments can be removed or exchanged. INTACS are also used as a treatment for keratoconus patients. Pros: For patients with progressive keratoconus, Intacs may defer a corneal transplant Reversible Patients may achieve a better fit and hence a more comfortable fit with their contact lenses Cons: Postoperative discomfort/pain for one to four days Fluctuating vision for weeks to months after the procedure Vision may not improve or change"

What is the Retina?,"Pediatric retina includes several rare diseases, many involving genetic predisposition, infection, trauma, or prematurity. Certain conditions, like retinopathy of prematurity, can develop in very premature infants while in neonatal nurseries and require multiple screenings. There are different kinds of pediatric retina conditions, including the following: Coats disease Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) Penetrating retinal injuries Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) Stargardt disease X-linked retinoschisis If you or your child notices any of the following, see a pediatric ophthalmologist: White pupils or an eye that appears white (rather than red) in photographs Full or partial vision loss Night blindness Black floaters within the field of vision Sudden, persistent flashing lights Any dramatic changes to the appearance of the eye Misalignment of the eyes or trouble focusing Sensitivity to light Pediatric surgeries are performed by University of Utah Health physicians at the John A. Moran Eye Center Surgery Unit and at Primary Children’s Hospital, a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center. Both operating suites are fully equipped to perform intricate vitreoretinal procedures on premature babies, infants, and children. The anesthesiologists at Primary Children’s specialize in anesthesia services for the tiniest preterm infant on up, and are skilled in managing anesthesia for the medically complex child."
What Is Strabismus?,"Strabismus is a common eye-movement disorder where the eyes are not aligned correctly. Either one or both eyes may turn inward, outward, up, or down, which is why strabismus is also called wandering eye or cross eyes. In most cases strabismus is caused by abnormal neuromuscular control of eye movement. Strabismus can also be caused by poor muscle strength. Strabismus affects adults and children in different ways. Symptoms of strabismus in children are usually mild. Parents may notice that children tilt their head to one side to compensate or close and cover the deviating eye. Diagnosing this condition early is very important to reduce the loss of the child’s vision. Symptoms of strabismus in adults may be more severe. Patients with this condition lose their binocular vision, which can cause double vision and loss of depth perception. As a result, patients may suffer from headaches or eye strain. Treatment of strabismus may include any of the following: Putting a patch over the stronger eye to increase strength in the weaker eye Eyeglasses Eye-drops Surgery to straighten the eyes Eye exercises About Us Academics & Research Billing Find an Interpreter Giving Jobs Maps & Directions Newsroom Referring Providers Patient Rights &."
What Is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that causes eye problems. It damages the blood vessels inside the retina and can cause blurred vision, vision floaters, and difficulty seeing colors. If left untreated, it can cause blindness. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, is a form of diabetic retinopathy. NDPR occurs when diabetes damages small blood vessels within the retina. These vessels start to leak both fluid and blood, gradually causing the retina to thicken or swell. Over time, the swelling, or edema, thickens the retina causing the vision to become blurred. Another form of diabetic retinopathy is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or PDR, which occurs when new and fragile blood vessels grow abnormally from the retina into the vitreous. This can result in bleeding, scarring, and contraction of the vitreous, which may lead to retinal detachment. PDR can cause severe vision problems, and it can even lead to blindness. It must be treated as soon as possible. Diabetic Retinopathy: PDR"

What Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?,"Age-related macular degeneration, also called AMD, is the deterioration of the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is the part of the retina which is responsible for our central vision and our ability to see color and fine detail when looking directly at an object. AMD is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 55. In the early stages of AMD, there is little or no vision loss. As the disease advances, images can become blurred, distorted, or a dark or empty area can appear in the center of the vision. AMD does not cause total blindness because side vision is not affected.> There is some good news relating to macular degeneration. With regular checkups, early diagnosis, and new treatment options, doctors are now able to prevent or minimize the damage that age-related macular degeneration can cause to vision. The most significant symptom of macular degeneration is blurred or distorted central vision. Over time, macular degeneration can affect vision by forming a blurred, darkened, or empty area in the center of vision, or it can distort one’s surroundings, most noticeably in the appearance of straight lines. Macular degeneration may also cause."
What is Retinal Detachment?,"The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts visual images into nerve impulses in the brain. Injuries to the eye can cause layers of the retina to separate, which is known as a retinal detachment. Any portion of the retina that is detached cannot send visual signals to the brain. If left untreated, retinal detachment can cause blindness. A retinal detachment is considered an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Anyone who has experienced trauma to the eye should see an ophthalmologist who can perform a dilated eye exam. Blunt eye trauma can cause bruises and scarring of the retina. Following a blunt trauma, tears can develop and lead to blinding retinal detachments at any time in life. Symptoms of retinal detachment include light flashes, floaters, and loss of vision. Both surgical and non-surgical procedures are used to treat retinal detachment. The best way to treat ocular trauma is to prevent it in the first place by wearing protective eyewear and avoiding hazardous conditions. Sports-related injuries, car accidents, fireworks, trampolines, and BB guns are some of the most common causes of eye injuries in children. Learn more about retinal detachment: National Eye Institute:."

What should I know about diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathyis the leading cause of blindness among working-age (ages 20–74) Americans. It's caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. With early diagnosis and treatment, you can prevent vision loss. People with diabetes should have a dilated eye exam each year, but only about two thirds follow this guideline. Managing diabetes including blood sugar level, blood pressure, and cholesterol control can prevent or delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy."
What should I know about cataracts?,"Cataractsare a major cause of vision loss, especially among Americans aged 40 years and older.

What eye problems can diabetes cause?,"Over time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which canharm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss andretinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage theoptic nerve(the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye).."
What are Cataracts?,"DownloadPDF Copy Cataracts are whitish or cloudy patches that develop in a person’s eye lens and lead to blurred or clouded vision. Cataracts are the most common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Cataracts can develop in one or both eyes and interrupt the flow of light through the lens. The lens is usually transparent, allowing light to pass though to the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts, however, cause the lens to become opaque and as the cataracts grow in size or number, vision gradually worsens, as less light is able to penetrate the lens. The eye is composed of the following structures: Eyeball: This is filled with a jelly like material called the vitreous humour Conjunctiva: The thin lining covering the sclera (white of the eye) Cornea: The clear, transparent layer over the pupil that lets in light Lens: The transparent structure at the front of the eye through which light passes Retina: A thin nerve membrane located behind the lens that detects light passing into the eye. Nerves in the retina send signals to the brain via the optic nerve to create an image. Optic nerve: This carries the information from the retina to the brain."
How Does the Eye Work?,"DownloadPDF Copy The human eye is a wonder of engineering. It consists of many different parts that work together to provide visual information to the brain, which then translates it into information that is useful to the body. 1. The cornea The first step in this complex process occurs when light passes through the clear slightly convex cornea at the very front of the eye. This is the transparent part of the eyeball. A thick white sheath called the sclera surrounds the rest of the eyeball. The cornea refracts light slightly. The narrow, liquid-filled space behind the cornea is called the aqueous humor. This drains through spaces at the medial corner of the eye, and is constantly renewed. 2. The iris The iris is a colored diaphragm of thin circular and longitudinal muscle fibers just behind the cornea. It has an aperture in the center. This can expand or contract to let in more or less light, respectively, depending on the light in the surroundings. This opening is called the pupil. Light passing through the cornea and the pupil falls on the anterior surface of the lens. The aqueous humor keeps the iris from sticking to the lens behind and."
What is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"DownloadPDF Copy Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of long-standing diabetes that affects vision. It describes damage to the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for transmitting nerve impulses to the visual centres in the brain via the optic nerve. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a persistenthigh blood sugarlevel. This can eventually damage the small blood vessels that supply the retina with nutrients and oxygen. The retina is then starved of vital nutrients as well as being potentially exposed to leakage from the damaged blood vessels which can blur vision. Without treatment, diabetic retinopathy can lead to a complete loss of vision. The retina lies at the back of the eye and is provided with a supply of blood vessels and nerves. In the initial stages of diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels that supply the retina develop tiny swellings called microaneurysms which are prone to hemorrahge. In addition, the interruption to the supply of nutrients and oxygen triggers the formation of new blood vessels across the eye. However, these new blood vessels are brittle and also prone to breakage. Both the microaneurysms and the new blood vessels may rupture causing the leakage of blood."
What is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is among the leading cause of permanent vision loss in most regions of the world. Damage to the optic nerve fibers resulting from glaucoma causes optic nerve cupping, which results in loss of vision and in some cases requires the removal of the eye. Glaucoma is the term for a group of conditions that cause the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells within the retina. Glaucoma affects over 70 million people globally, making it the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Glaucoma often does not produce any symptoms until it has become severe. Surveys show that only about 10% to 50% of individuals with glaucoma actually realize they have it. Glaucoma is classified into two main categories, open-angle glaucoma, and angle-closure glaucoma, both of which cause primary glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form, but angle-closure glaucoma is responsible for more cases of very severe vision loss. Secondary glaucoma can result from trauma, inflammation, tumors, medications (e.g. corticosteroids), and certain conditions (e.g. pigment dispersion). Many studies have discovered an increased risk of developing glaucoma with a higher cup-disk ratio (CDR), CDR asymmetry, hemorrhaging of the disc, or increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The risk of developing glaucoma."
What is a retinal break?,"About 80% of the eye is filled with a gel-like vitreous body, which gives the eye its round contour. This is crisscrossed by millions of very fine connective tissue fibers, which are attached more or less loosely to the retinal surface. In most patients, the vitreous humor contracts with age. In areas where the fibers are firmly attached, the retina tears due to the pulling away of the vitreous. This creates a retinal hole. Thus, retinal breaks are holes in the retina that occur mostly when the vitreous body in front of the retina contracts and tugs on it. This leads to the seepage of fluid underneath the retina through the break. As a result, the retina in that area detaches from the underlying RPE. This is also called a rhegmatogenous retinal break and is seen in a quarter of patients who present with posterior vitreous detachment. This shoots up to two-thirds of the patient also has associated vitreous hemorrhage. Other reasons for a retinal break to occur include: Any condition which causes degeneration of the peripheral retina The trauma of the eye Surgery on the eye High myopia Macular pucker in rare cases Retinal breaks may be peripheral or."
Should You Seek Help for Eye Floaters?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye floaters are shadows of the cell strands that are present in the vitreous of the eye. Though many floaters do not cause harm to the affected individual, there are some conditions in which an individual should seek physician help, as floaters in these situations could indicate benign diseases. Some floaters can also be a sign of vision-threatening diseases. When the disease is diagnosed and treated, it can restore eye health and also cure floaters. Floaters can be due to ocular or non-ocular reasons. In any event, if an individual suddenly experiences any one of the below symptoms, it is a warning sign to consult a physician: New floaters obstructing vision Increase in the number of floaters Light flashes with or without floaters Low vision Shadows in the peripheral vision Dark or gray shapes in the sides of the vision Increase in the size of floaters. As humans age, the gel-like vitreous humor that maintains the shape of the eye gradually liquefies. Some of the gel-like particles float in the liquid consistency, which causes the retina to cast shadows of these shapes, which leads to the appearance of floaters. Floaters are most common in old age and are."
What are the Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma actually refers to a group of disorders. Open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma are the two major types of glaucoma. Both the types are characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), or pressure inside the eye."
What is the Most Common Form of Glaucoma?,"Open-angle glaucoma, the most common formofglaucoma, is caused by blockageof the trabecular meshwork or drainage canals. The “open-angle” designation refers to the preservation of a wide and open angle between the iris and cornea. The condition develops slowly over a lifetime, and symptoms are gradual and often go unnoticed. Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by an imbalance in the production and drainage of aqueous humor (eye fluid). Blockageof drainage canals causes fluid accumulation in the eye chamber, which in turn causes increased IOP. Vision loss from this type is first evident peripherally, then moves centrally. Angle-closure glaucoma is also referred to as acute or narrow-angle glaucoma. As evident by its name, angle-closure glaucoma results from the narrowing of the angle between the iris and cornea. The condition is characterized by blocked drainage canals, which results in a sudden rise in the IOP. In contrast to open-angle glaucoma, this type develops quickly and has very noticeable symptoms. The severe nature of the condition warrants immediate medical attention and prompt treatment. Open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma can also include variants such as secondary glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma, and traumatic glaucoma. Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG) is also called normal-pressure or low-tension glaucoma. It is characterized by optic."
What are Aberrations of the Eye?,DownloadPDF Copy The human eye can be affected by a number of aberrations which can reduce the quality of retinal images and general visual perception. Research has shown that age increases the probability of developing higher order aberrations in particular.
What are Aberrations of the Eye?,"Described as small optical irregularities, aberrations are imperfections of the eye that result in light being unable to focus onto the retina effectively as well as defects in visual image. There are two types of aberrations; lower-order aberrations (0, 1st and 2nd order), and higher-order aberrations (3rd,4th…). Higher order aberrations (HOAs) of the eye are unable to be corrected by cylinder or spherical corrections and include spherical aberrations, coma and trefoil. Coma aberrations are caused when light rays from one edge of the pupil focuses before those from the opposing edge. Visually those with this type of aberration may experience smearing of an image so that images may appear to have a tail like a comet. Classed as a third order aberration, trefoil has a more minor affect on image quality compared to an equal amount of coma. Spherical aberrations can cause halos surrounding point light sources and a reduction in contrast sensitivity. It is thought that HOAs are responsible for individuals reporting complaints of glare, halos and reduction in contrast sensitivity following corneal refractive surgery. Approximately 90% of aberrations are caused by the cornea. The eyes of young people tend to be less affected by higher order aberrations due."
What Causes Eye Floaters?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye floaters (myodesopsias) emerge as a consequence of opacities developed in the vitreous fluid of the eye. The fibers in the vitreous create shadows on the retina and these shadows are called floaters. Based on the size and shape of the fibers, floaters may appear as black spots, thread-like, or a small piece of cobweb. When the eye moves, these fibers move in the vitreous fluid and become visible. Floaters are dark or semi-transparent and are visible while staring at a surface that is light-colored or when exposed to bright light. When we try to look at a floater, it will tend to move away in the direction in which the eye is being moved. Eye floaters showing whilst looking at a blue sky.Image Credit: meyerandmeyer / Shutterstock.com A human eye is comprised of 1) anterior chamber 2) vitreous chamber and 3) posterior chamber. The vitreous chamber covers approximately 80% of the eyeball. The vitreous humor or vitreous is a colorless fluid present in between the retina and lens in the eye. Vitreous humor is comprised of 99% of water, and the remaining 1% is a mixture of collagen fibers, large molecules of hyaluronic acid, hyalocytes, inorganic salts,."

Optometrists work in hospitals, clinics, the ophthalmic industry, teaching institutions, and on research projects; however, they majorly contribute their services in clinical practice, hospitals, and public health centers. Clinically, optometrists aim to provide solutions to patients with eye disorders. First, patients are subjected to general eye examinations in which the optometrist takes the patient’s medical history of his eye problems. Following this, the eyes are checked for refractive errors and a visual acuity test is carried out to evaluate the eyesight. if required, spectacles or contact lenses of the calculated refractive status of the eyes are prescribed, in order to attain proper vision.A Day in the Life - OptometristPlayRole of optometrists in clinical practiceClinically, optometrists aim to provide solutions to patients with eye disorders.

What is eye cancer?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye cancer, as the name suggests begins in the eye. The eye is composed of various smaller structures each of which can be affected. A cancer or tumor is basically an uncontrolled growth of any particular cell or group of cells. This tumor may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancerous tumors are fast growing, fast spreading and may be fatal if not treated. Eye cancers like other eye diseases are treated by Ophthalmologists and oncologists (cancer specialists). The normal eye has three basic parts (1, 2) – Associated structures of the eye. These include – The eyeball or the globe.

What is LASIK?,"DownloadPDF Copy LASIK is a surgical procedure where the cornea of the eye is reshaped in order to reduce a person’s dependency on glasses or contact lenses. The acronym LASIK stands forLaserInSituKeratomileusis because an excimer laser (a type of ultraviolet laser) is used. It is similar to other corrective procedures such as photorefractive keratectomy but provides several additional benefits – primarily a quicker recovery period. Image Credit: BLACKDAY/Shutterstock.com Like any other procedure, the results of LASIK surgery are determined on the basis of certain parameters that includeefficacy, predictability, stability, safety and patient satisfaction. It is crucial that the surgeon evaluates the patient’s expectations of LASIK surgery and make sure that they are realistic. The LASIK procedure involves increasing the eye’s intraocular pressure to at least 65 mmHg with a suction device. Then a mechanical microkeratome (a blade device) or a laser keratome (a laser device) is used to create a corneal flap at least 6 mm in diameter and 150 microns thick. This flap is then folded back revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea, which is reshaped by the pulses from a computer-controlled excimer laser beam. The size of the optical zone and the depth of the."
What is Normal-Tension Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, develops slowly and has symptoms that often go unnoticed. Raised IOP is a hallmark of most forms on glaucoma. However, in certain conditions, optic nerve damage may occur even when the IOP is below the normal level of 21 mm Hg. This form of glaucoma is commonly referred to as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). NTG is associated with glaucomatous optic nerve damage, progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fiber, and visual field defects."
What are the risk factors for normal tension glaucoma?,"Some factors that predispose persons to increased risk of developing NTG are Family history of NTG - The TANK-binding kinase 1 gene has been found to be associated with NTG development. Japanese ancestry –The condition occurs most commonly among Japanese persons. Persons with a history of heart disease such as irregular heart rhythm, vascular dysfunction and ischemia. Female patients – The condition is more prevalent in females than male. Persons with hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance."
How is normal-tension glaucoma diagnosed?,"Medical history A complete medical history is taken with special emphasis on history of head injury. Past episodes of migraine, shock, neurological symptoms, and Raynaud's phenomenon are also investigated. The doctor may also inquire regarding the use of medications such as systemic steroids and beta blockers. Visualizing the optic nerve damage Advanced neuroimaging reveals surprising link between glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease Targeted ocular spectroscopy shines new light on retinal health Does your ADHD medication increase your risk of glaucoma? NTG is diagnosed by observing the optic nerve for signs of damage. This is done using an ophthalmoscope or by visual field testing. The ophthalmoscope is a non-invasive test used to examine the shape of the optic nerve. A nerve that is cupped and not a healthy pink color suggest abnormality. A visual field test provides a map of the patient’s complete field of vision. The test can detect damage to the optic nerve and is useful to detect dysfunction in central and peripheral vision. Other diagnostic tests Blood pressure should be monitored for at least 24 hours to exclude the possibility of nocturnal systemic hypotension, which may cause NTG Certain blood tests are carried out to further confirm the diagnosis.."
What is Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is an irreversible optic neuropathy characterised by peripheral visual loss that usually precedes central vision loss. Due to its chronic nature and lack of early indicators of disease progression, OAG is a major health concern worldwide."
How does Open-Angle Glaucoma develop?,"Glaucoma, is characterised by an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The trabecular meshwork is a specialized region in the eye that adjusts the IOP by regulating the aqueous humor outflow from the eye. In OAG, this meshwork is blocked, and an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor results. The accumulation of aqueous humor in the eye chamber increases the IOP to a level that leads to optic neuropathy. The exact pathogenesis of optic neuropathy is not known. However, following are the two main proposed mechanisms: Vascular dysfunction – Which results in ischemia or an inadequate blood supply to the optic nerve Mechanical dysfunction - Which occurs due to the compression of the axons by the cribriform plate."
What are the risk factors for the development of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"OAG is most common in individuals who have a previous history of elevated IOP. African-Americans, elderly persons, and those with a family history of glaucoma are more at risk. Smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, anxiety, stress, and sleep apnea may also increase the risk of OAG. Elevated IOP is the most readily treatable risk factor."
What are the symptoms of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"The condition is asymptomatic in the initial stages, and patients do not present with any complaints until late in the course of the disease. Vision loss from this type begins peripherally and  gradually moves to the center. Due to the silent and progressive nature of OAG, clinical evaluation is warranted in individuals at high risk."
What are the screening options for Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"In asymptomatic patients younger than 40 years, screening is recommended every three to five years. However, in African Americans, persons older than 40 years, and those with multiple risk factors, screening is recommended more frequently. Screening usually includes a complete medical history, eye examination using a gonioscope, binocular views of the optic discs, and a quantitative visual field test."
What is the Management of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"With timely screening and treatment, glaucoma can be identified at an early stage and its progress can be halted before the disease significantly affects vision. The main goal is to reduce IOP before the disease progresses to cause complete vision loss. Drugs used to treat open-angle glaucoma include alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, miotics, and prostaglandin analogs. The treatment strategy usually involves taking into consideration the risk factors, adverse effects related to the drug use, the patient’s life expectancy, medical history, and concomitant conditions. Surgery is the next option in cases where IOP worsens even after administration of the maximum tolerated medical therapy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441887/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068436 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4523637/ All Glaucoma Content What is Glaucoma?

What is Traumatic Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Among young people, ocular injuries are common and comprise an important cause of preventable visual morbidity. Although ocular trauma is common, many injuries are minor and do not require hospital admission. However, it should be noted that certain ocular injuries are serious and potentially fatal. Certain forms of ocular trauma can manifest later as  secondary glaucoma, also known as traumatic glaucoma. Traumatic glaucoma is clinically defined as a post-traumatic rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) more than 21 mm Hg. Traumatic glaucoma can develop due to blunt trauma or injuries that bruise the eye; however, some forms are caused due to penetrating eye injuries. The development of the condition varies and may be acute or chronic in onset."
What causes traumatic glaucoma?,"Elevated IOP following trauma results from a multitude of factors. Drainage impairment may occur at the trabecular meshwork due to injury and hyphema, a pooling of blood inside the anterior chamber of the eye. Injury and inflammation to the lens or iris can also lead to the development of traumatic glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) may also develop. These adhesions between the peripheral iris and the angular structures of the anterior chamber reduce outflow of aqueous humor (eye fluid), resulting in increased intraocular pressure."
What are the signs and symptoms of traumatic glaucoma?,"Aching pain in the eye – This may occur immediately after the injury Light sensitivity Blurred vision Blood collection (hyphema) and inflammation in the eye Elevated eye pressure –due to the blockage of the eye canals with blood and inflammatory cells Pain may subside after the resolution of hyphema and inflammation, but the eye pressure may remain elevated. Although painless, increased IOP can cause significant damage to the optic nerve. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a long time until the visual loss has progressed to an advanced stage."
How is traumatic glaucoma diagnosed?,"Doctors usually start by carrying out a complete eye examination to assess the extent of the damage. After confirming that the eye is not ruptured, the doctor examines the IOP and the angle structures. The angle structures are measured using a slit lamp microscope and a gonioscope. Imaging can also be done performed with ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). If the optic nerve show signs of glaucoma, the following additional tests are carried out. Optic nerve thickness measurements Visual field testing and screening for early visual field loss"
How is traumatic glaucoma treated?,"The treatment goal for all forms of glaucoma is lowering IOP to less than 21 mm Hg. The pressure should be lowered in such a way that the optic nerve is not further damaged. Google Gemini and Bard pass the ophthalmology board examination Does your ADHD medication increase your risk of glaucoma? Does cannabis use impact the risk of glaucoma? New study investigates The treatment strategy for traumatic glaucoma includes a combination of pharmacologic agents with or without surgery. Pharmacologic agents used to treat traumatic glaucoma include beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogues, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Beta-blockers are the first choice agents. They decrease IOP by reducing the aqueous fluid inflow. Prostaglandin analogues relax the eye muscles and facilitate outflow of fluids, which, in turn, reduces IOP. Alpha-adrenergic agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease the rate of aqueous humor production. Steroids can help treat inflammation. Surgery is considered when maximally tolerated medical therapy has failed and when the risk of progressive visual loss outweighs the risk of surgery. Argon laser trabeculoplasty, alternative laser procedures, and filtration surgery are possible surgical options.If left untreated, traumatic glaucoma can cause permanent, irreversible damage to vision. Therefore, an eye examination is highly recommended following."
What is Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Glaucoma is a common ocular condition whereby damage is caused to the optic nerve connecting the eye to the brain. Image Credit: Olena Yakobchuk/Shutterstock.com It is considered to be the second greatest factor causing permanent blindness in the US and typically affects aging adults. Generally, glaucoma is referred to as an acquired loss of axons of the optic nerve and ganglion cells of the retina or optic neuropathy which leads to progressive vision loss. The condition can affect both eyes, yet, progression may differ between each eye, meaning glaucoma may be worse in one eye. One of the main features of glaucoma is high intraocular pressure. The eye’s anterior chamber which hosts the cornea, iris, lens, and pupil is filled by aqueous humor a clear, water-like fluid. This fluid helps nourish the lens and cornea by supplying them with vital nutrients and oxygen. Other functions include providing the necessary pressure to maintain the eye’s shape, referred to as intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma typically develops as a result of a blockage in the eye’s drainage tubes called the trabecular meshwork. Due to the blockage, the aqueous humor is unable to flow, causing pressure to build up in the eye.."
What Causes Retinal Detachment?,"DownloadPDF Copy The retina is the layer of the eye that contains light-sensitive nerve cells or photoreceptors. It receives and transmits light stimuli to the brain, enabling the body to see. It lines the inside of the eye, resting upon a pigmented layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This nourishes and renews the retinal photopigments, maintaining normal visual function. When the retina pulls away from the underlying RPE it is called a retinal detachment. There are three types of retinal detachment, as described below: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment:This is caused by a tear or hole in the retina which allows fluid from the vitreous chamber to seep underneath the retinal layers and separate it or peel it off the RPE. This is the most common type. Tractional retinal detachment:In this case the scar tissue on the retinal surface contracts, pulling against the RPE and creating retinal detachment. This is more often seen in diabetics, those with a history of prior retinal surgery, and inflammatory conditions which result in scarring. Serous/exudative retinal detachment:This is caused by exudation of fluid under the intact retina, causing its detachment from the RPE. This is seen in inflammatory or traumatic conditions, which increase the rate."
Does your ADHD medication increase your risk of glaucoma?,"The risks of glaucoma among users of ADHD medications. Fu-Shin Yu, Ph.D., professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences in the Wayne State University School of Medicine, received an award from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health for his study aiming to reverse the adverse effects of diabetes on eyesight. A group of researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, University of Freiburg and the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience have created an exceptionally small implant, with electrodes the size of a single neuron that can also remain intact in the body over time – a unique combination that holds promise for future vision implants for the blind. About 79% of clinical trial participants experienced measurable improvement after receiving experimental, CRISPR-based gene editing that is designed to fix a rare form of blindness, according to a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
