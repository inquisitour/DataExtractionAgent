Question,Answer
Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: What’s the Difference?,"An optometrist treats your eyes. In contrast, an ophthalmologist focuses on doing surgical procedures for eye conditions, while an optician helps you fit eyeglasses and other vision-correcting devices."
What is an optometrist and what do they do?,An optometrist is the primary health care provider for routine eye care.
What is an ophthalmologist and what do they do?,An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in surgical eye procedures.
What Are the Job Duties of an Optometrist?,"When someone starts having vision trouble, they see an optometrist for basic vision care. Optometrists do routine vision checks and tests, examine other parts of the visual system and diagnose and treat minor eye problems, diseases and injuries."
How Do the Job Duties of an Ophthalmologist Differ From an Optometrist?,"Ophthalmologists can do all the above duties that optometrists can, as well as perform eye surgery. They have the additional skills to specialize in surgery for conditions like glaucoma and cataracts. They also perform corneal, vitro-retinal, eye muscle and oculoplastic surgeries."
Where Do Optometrists and Ophthalmologists Work?,"Many optometrists own their practices, sometimes working in a practice with other optometrists. Some optometrists only work with a certain population, specializing in one type of eye care such as pediatrics or low vision. Optometrists also find employment in postsecondary education, as consultants and in research roles."
What Is the Average Optometrist Salary?,"According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for optometrists was$110,300, as of May 2017. This means that half of the industry made more and half made less. Those in the top 10 percent of earners made$190,090, while the bottom 10 percent brought home less than$53,740."
What Is the Average Ophthalmologist Salary?,"Ophthalmologists earn an average of$357,000a year, according to the Medscape Ophthalmologist Compensation Report from 2018. The salary for self-employed ophthalmologists is$429,000, higher than the salary for those working for other entities, which is an average of$256,000."
Where Do Optometrists Work?,"From2016to2026,the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the field of optometry to grow nearly18 percent. That’s a significant difference from the seven percent growth expected across all occupations. Jobs for ophthalmologists are expected to grow nearly11 percentduring that same time period."
What Are the Symptoms of Glaucoma?,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision."
What Causes Glaucoma?,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye."
What Are the Types of Glaucoma?,Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are:
Who Is at Risk of Glaucoma?,"According to theWorld Health Organization(WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include:"
How Is Glaucoma Diagnosed?,"To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They’ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures:"
How Is Glaucoma Treated?,"The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don’t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments:"
Will a Person with Glaucoma Go Blind?,"If your increased IOP can be stopped and the pressure returned to normal, vision loss can be slowed or even stopped. However, because there’s no cure for glaucoma, you’ll likely need treatment for the rest of your life to regulate your IOP. Unfortunately, vision lost as a result of glaucoma cannot be restored."
Can Glaucoma Be Prevented?,"Glaucoma can’t be prevented, but it’s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss."
What causes crossed eyes?,"Crossed eyes occur either due to nerve damage or when the muscles around your eyes don’t work together because some are weaker than others. When your brain receives a different visual message from each eye, it ignores the signals coming from your weaker eye."
How is crossed eyes diagnosed?,"To prevent vision loss, early diagnosis and treatment for crossed eyes is important. If you develop symptoms of crossed eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor. They’ll perform a series of tests to check the health of your eyes that may include:"
Who is at risk of crossed eyes?,You’re more likely to develop crossed eyes if you:
How are crossed eyes treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan for crossed eyes will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your condition. If your crossed eyes have resulted from a lazy eye, your doctor may have you wear a patch over your stronger eye to force the muscles of your weaker eye to work harder."
What is the long-term outlook for crossed eyes?,"Often crossed eyes can be corrected with corrective lenses, eye patches, surgery in rare cases, or by other modalities."
What is a doctor of optometry/optometrist?,"Doctors of optometry (O.D.s/optometrists), America’s primary eye health care providers, are the frontline of eye and vision care. Doctors of optometry are essential health care providers and are recognized as physicians under Medicare. They examine, diagnose, treat and manage diseases and disorders of the eye. In addition to providing eye and vision care, they play a major role in an individual’s overall health and well-being by detecting systemic diseases, and diagnosing, treating and managing ocular manifestations of those diseases, and providing vaccinations."
What is a comprehensive eye exam?,"Acomprehensive eye examconducted by a doctor of optometry determines the eye and vision health of a patient. During the exam, the doctor checks not only visual acuity through refraction but also the health of your eyes, eye tissue and other diseases. Each patient's symptoms, along with the doctor of optometry’s professional judgment, will determine what tests are conducted."
Why is it important to get comprehensive eye exams with a doctor of optometry?,"An in-person, comprehensive eye exam with a doctor of optometry is the medically recognized standard to assure precise and healthy vision, identify and treat diseases, such as glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In addition, eye exams safeguard overall health by enabling the doctor todetect more than 270 serious health conditionsincluding diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases and cancers. In fact, in 2018 alone, doctors of optometry identified signs of diabetes in more than 301,000 patients who did not know they had the condition. In-person, comprehensive eye exams are one of the most important, preventive ways to preserve vision and..."
What is the difference between a comprehensive eye exam and a vision screening?,"Current vision screening methods cannot be relied on to effectively identify individuals who need vision care. These types of screenings are offered at schools, pediatrician offices or at the DMV. While they may uncover some vision problems, they can miss more than they find. In some cases, vision screenings can give a false sense of security for those individuals who ""pass"" the screening and inhibit the early diagnosis of vision problems. These people are then less likely to receive treatment for their vision problem and it could become worse."
Eye Numbing Drops: Why Are They Used and Are They Safe?,"Medical professionals use eye numbing drops to block the nerves in your eye from feeling pain or discomfort. If you’re pregnant or nursing, tell your doctor before getting eye numbing drops."
Can I buy eye numbing drops over the counter?,"Eye numbing drops are not available over the counter. These drops should only be applied under the supervision of a medical professional to avoid serious side effects and, in some cases,chemical dependency."
How does astigmatism affect my vision?,Astigmatismis a common vision condition that causes blurriness or distorted vision. It can affect the way light refracts on the retina.
What is 20/20 vision?,"20/20 vision means you have normal visual acuity (or sharpness and clarity) at a distance of 20 feet away. It doesn’t mean perfect vision, though. It only means you can see clearly at a distance."
Will your vision get worse?,"Vision doesn’t worsen as a result of getting older, but your risk for eye-related conditions and diseases does get increase as you age."
How often should you get your eyes checked?,"Your prescription can change, so it’s important to get regular eye exams. Adults ages 19 to 40 with vision problems should get their eyes checked at least every two years. Adults older than 40 should get them checked once a year."
How Long Does It Take for the Effects from Eye Dilation Drops to Wear Off?,"Getting your eyes dilated is an important part of any complete eye exam. Once your doctor puts in the dilating drops, it takes about 20–30 minutes for your pupils to fully open, or dilate."
What are the side effects of eye dilation drops?,"Dilation is harmless in the long term, but it does come with short-term side effects. These will usually last for about four to six hours."
Why is eye dilation important?,"Dilation allows an eye doctor to look inside your eyes. Dilating drops widen the pupil (the black part of your eye) so that it doesn’t get smaller when your doctor shines a light at it. The widened pupil allows your doctor to use a magnifying lens to look inside your eye and at the back of your eye. They’ll look at the retina, optic nerve, blood vessels, and other parts of your eye that can’t otherwise be seen."
What causes your eye to hurt when you blink?,"Common causes for eye pain when you blink include dry eyes, a stye, or pink eye (conjunctivitis). More serious conditions that can cause your eye to hurt when you blink include glaucoma or optic neuritis."
What is an ophthalmologist?,Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with additional specialist training in the diagnosis and management of disorders of the eye and visual system. They are also sometimes called eye doctors or eye surgeons.
What does an ophthalmologist do?,"Ophthalmologists are surgeons, and can do:"
When do I see an ophthalmologist?,Your doctor or optometrist may refer you to an ophthalmologist if you have:
What questions should I ask an ophthalmologist?,"Before you go to your first appointment, note down any questions you have. During the consultation, ask for clarification if you don’t understand what is said."
How do I find an ophthalmologist?,Ask your doctor or optometrist for a recommendation or use the healthdirect service finder to locate an ophthalmologist in your area.
Do I need a referral to see an ophthalmologist?,"It is important to get areferralfrom your doctor or optometrist to see an ophthalmologist. This is so that they can pass on useful important health information, and the ophthalmologist can later tell the doctor or optometrist about the results of your visit and any tests performed."
How much will an ophthalmologist cost?,"Thecostsof an ophthalmologist visit vary greatly, depending on the type of care you receive. Factors include whether it’s inhospital, whether you haveprivate health insurance, and what the ophthalmologistcharges."
"Optometrists, orthoptists and ophthalmologists: What’s the difference?","Optometrists are different from ophthalmologists. They can prescribe and fit glasses and contact lenses. They are also trained in screening for serious eye conditions such as glaucoma, but they are not doctors. Optometrists can give advice on visual problems and treat minor eye problems but will refer you to an ophthalmologist for the diagnosis and treatment of more serious eye conditions."
Why is cataract surgery performed?,A cataract is an eye condition where the lens of your one or both of your eyes becomes cloudy.
Who does cataract surgery?,Cataract surgery is performed by anophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor). Your doctor or optometrist can help you tofind the right health professionalfor cataract treatment.
What happens during cataract surgery?,"On the day of the surgery, you will be given eye drops that include anantibiotic. You might be given an injection around your eye or eye drops to make the eye go numb. Most people have alocal anaesthetic and light sedation."
What are the risks of having cataract surgery?,"Problems with cataract surgery are uncommon. Some people have bleeding, an infection or damage to their eye."
Are there alternatives to cataract surgery?,"During the early stages of cataracts, you may find that new glasses, improved lighting or other visual aids help."
What is short-sightedness?,"Short-sightedness (also known as myopia) is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred. Someone with myopia can achieve good vision with prescription glasses, contact lenses or laser surgery. Short-sightedness usually first appears in childhood."
How is short-sightedness caused?,"When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) and the lens. If you have normal vision, the light waves are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are short-sighted, the light waves from distant objects focus in front of, rather than on, the retina."
How is short-sightedness diagnosed?,An eye test using an eye chart will allow an optometrist or ophthalmologist to diagnose short-sightedness.
How is short-sightedness treated?,"Short-sightedness is usually corrected with prescription glasses. Contact lenses are also an option, but generally not for children.Laser refractive eye surgeryis now also common, but is only appropriate for adults."
What is long-sightedness?,"Long-sightedness (also known as hyperopia) is a common eye condition that can be hard to detect. It makes close objects appear blurry, or you might be able to focus clearly but get tired eyes or headaches. For people with significant long-sightedness, vision can be blurry for things in the distance as well."
How is long-sightedness caused?,The size and shape of the eye largely causes long-sightedness.
How is long-sightedness diagnosed?,"Standard vision screening tests might not detect long-sightedness, but an optometrist or ophthalmologist can measure how well your eye focuses as part of an eye examination."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a commoneyecondition where the cornea or lens in your eye is not perfectly curved. Instead of being shaped like a soccer ball, it is curved like a rugby ball. This means that light entering the eye focuses at 2 places (rather than one) on the retina."
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,Symptoms of astigmatism may include:
What causes astigmatism?,"There are several potential causes of astigmatism, including:"
When should I have an eye test?,"You should have an eye test if you experience any trouble with your vision, for example:"
How is astigmatism diagnosed?,Your optometrist orophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor)can diagnose astigmatism with an eye examination.
How is astigmatism treated?,"Your healthcare professional can treat your astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses. Most people have mild astigmatism, and this treatment is enough."
What is strabismus?,Strabismus (or ‘squint’) is where one of your eyes points in towards your nose (convergent) or out towards your ear (divergent). Sometimes one eye may point up or down. Strabismus may be present all the time or only sometimes.
How does strabismus happen?,"Strabismus in adults can happen because of disease that affects your eye muscles (such as thyroid eye disease and myasthenia), disease that affects the nerves to your eye muscles (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) or trauma (where a physical force is applied directly to your eye)."
What is eye cancer?,Eye cancer develops when abnormal cells in your eye grow and divide in an uncontrolled way.
What are the types of eye cancer?,"If the cancer starts to grow in the eye itself, it is called a primary cancer. If the cancer spreads to the eye (metastasises) from another body part, such as thebreastorlungsit is called a secondary cancer."
What are the symptoms of eye cancer?,"Many people with eye cancer do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may find the condition when you have a routineeye test.If you do have symptoms, you may notice:"
What causes eye cancer?,"Doctors don't fully understand why eye cancer develops, but there are some factors that increase your risk of eye melanoma, including:"
How is eye cancer diagnosed?,"If your doctor thinks you might have eye cancer, they will examine the outside of your eye and use special instruments to look inside it."
How is eye cancer treated?,The type of treatment will depend on the type of eye cancer and how far it has spread (known as itsstage).
What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common eye problem that causes vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve. If untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness."
What are the types of glaucoma?,There are several different types of glaucoma. The 2 main types of glaucoma are:
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,Most people with glaucoma have few or no symptoms until their eyesight is damaged.
What causes glaucoma?,Doctors don’t clearly understand why glaucoma happens.
Who is at risk of glaucoma?,You are at higher risk of developing glaucoma if you:
How is glaucoma diagnosed?,"An optometrist orophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor) can detect it early on if you have regulareye examinationsevery 1 to 2 years. They will look at the nerve fibres and the structure of the eye drainage network, test the field of vision and measure the eye pressure. This examination will take 20 to 45 minutes."
How is glaucoma treated?,"If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you need prompt treatment to reduce the pressure. This may be done with eye drops or an intravenous medicine. You may also need surgery."
Can glaucoma be prevented?,"Unfortunately, while it can be managed, glaucoma can’t be prevented."
Will I get my vision back after retinal detachment?,"The amount of vision recovered after surgery will depend on how much of your retina has detached. Overall, about 95 per cent of cases of retinal detachment will be able to be repaired, with at least some vision preserved. Theoutcomeis worse if the macula (central vision) is involved. The quicker you can see an eye specialist, the better the results of surgery may be."
Does your child need to see a health professional about lazy eye symptoms?,"Yes. If you notice that your child has any of the signs above or you’re worried about your child’s vision, start by seeing yourGPorchild and family health nurse. They can refer your child to anoptometristorophthalmologistif your child needs more tests and checks."
