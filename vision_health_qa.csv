Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: What’s the Difference?,"Optometrist Ophthalmologist Optician Bottom line An optometrist treats your eyes. In contrast, an ophthalmologist focuses on doing surgical procedures for eye conditions, while an optician helps you fit eyeglasses and other vision-correcting devices. If you’ve ever had to search for an eye care doctor, you’re likely aware that there are several different types of eye specialists. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians are all professionals who specialize in eye care. In this article, we will explore the education requirements, salary, scope of practice, and services that optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians provide. We will also discuss how to choose the best eye-care professional..."
What is an optometrist and what do they do?,An optometrist is the primary health care provider for routine eye care.
What is an ophthalmologist and what do they do?,An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in surgical eye procedures.
What Are the Job Duties of an Optometrist?,"When someone starts having vision trouble, they see an optometrist for basic vision care. Optometrists do routine vision checks and tests, examine other parts of the visual system and diagnose and treat minor eye problems, diseases and injuries. If necessary, the optometrist prescribes glasses or contact lenses, finding the right vision correction level and fit for each person. They also do minor surgical procedures, offer pre- and post-op care for more involved surgeries with an ophthalmologist and promote general eye health and care."
How Do the Job Duties of an Ophthalmologist Differ From an Optometrist?,"Ophthalmologists can do all the above duties that optometrists can, as well as perform eye surgery. They have the additional skills to specialize in surgery for conditions like glaucoma and cataracts. They also perform corneal, vitro-retinal, eye muscle and oculoplastic surgeries. Before surgery even takes place, the ophthalmologist puts the patient through a complete exam to diagnose the issue and create the best treatment plan. An ophthalmologist can also treat more complicated eye injuries, including those dealing with other eye structures like the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva and eyelids."
Where Do Optometrists and Ophthalmologists Work?,"Many optometrists own their practices, sometimes working in a practice with other optometrists. Some optometrists only work with a certain population, specializing in one type of eye care such as pediatrics or low vision. Optometrists also find employment in postsecondary education, as consultants and in research roles. Ophthalmologists work in mostly in hospitals and surgery centers, but some also have their own practices. Both generally work full-time, putting in hours in the evenings and on the weekends to fit patient schedules."
What Is the Average Optometrist Salary?,"According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for optometrists was$110,300, as of May 2017. This means that half of the industry made more and half made less. Those in the top 10 percent of earners made$190,090, while the bottom 10 percent brought home less than$53,740. Optometrists employed in private doctor practices made the most at$124,060, while those in government roles made the least at$94,280. These states have the highest averageeye doctor salary: Connecticut ($192,870). Alaska ($187,800). Maryland ($141,870). Oklahoma ($136,740). Massachusetts ($135,780)."
What Is the Average Ophthalmologist Salary?,"Ophthalmologists earn an average of$357,000a year, according to the Medscape Ophthalmologist Compensation Report from 2018. The salary for self-employed ophthalmologists is$429,000, higher than the salary for those working for other entities, which is an average of$256,000. More years of experience generally equals higher pay. Those with 0 to 5 years of experience earn an average of$180,000, while 20-plus years of experience gets you about$270,000a year."
What Are the Symptoms of Glaucoma?,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision. Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: severe eye pain nausea vomiting redness in your eye sudden vision disturbances seeing colored rings around lights sudden blurred vision"
What Causes Glaucoma?,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye. What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe.................."
What Are the Types of Glaucoma?,Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are:
Who Is at Risk of Glaucoma?,"According to theWorld Health Organization(WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include:"
How Is Glaucoma Diagnosed?,"To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They’ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures:"
How Is Glaucoma Treated?,"The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don’t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments:"
Will a Person with Glaucoma Go Blind?,"If your increased IOP can be stopped and the pressure returned to normal, vision loss can be slowed or even stopped. However, because there’s no cure for glaucoma, you’ll likely need treatment for the rest of your life to regulate your IOP. Unfortunately, vision lost as a result of glaucoma cannot be restored."
Can Glaucoma Be Prevented?,"Glaucoma can’t be prevented, but it’s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss. Last medically reviewed on  January 29, 2016"
What causes crossed eyes?,"Crossed eyes occur either due to nerve damage or when the muscles around your eyes don’t work together because some are weaker than others. When your brain receives a different visual message from each eye, it ignores the signals coming from your weaker eye. If your condition isn’t corrected, you may lose vision in your weaker eye. Crossed eyes are common in children. Often the underlying cause is unknown. Infantile esotropia is a type of crossed eyes that appears in babies during their first year of life. Esotropia runs in families and usually requires surgery to correct. Acquired esotropia occurs......"
How is crossed eyes diagnosed?,"To prevent vision loss, early diagnosis and treatment for crossed eyes is important. If you develop symptoms of crossed eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor. They’ll perform a series of tests to check the health of your eyes that may include: a corneal light reflex test to check for crossed eyes avisual acuity testto determine how well you can read from a distance a cover/uncover test to measure your eye movement and deviation a retina exam to examine the backs of your eyes If you have other physical symptoms along with crossed eyes, your doctor may examine your......"
Who is at risk of crossed eyes?,"You’re more likely to develop crossed eyes if you: have family members who have crossed eyes have a brain disorder or brain tumor have had a stroke or brain injury have a lazy eye, are farsighted, or have vision loss have a damaged retina havediabetes"
How are crossed eyes treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan for crossed eyes will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your condition. If your crossed eyes have resulted from a lazy eye, your doctor may have you wear a patch over your stronger eye to force the muscles of your weaker eye to work harder. Your doctor might also prescribe eye drops to blur the vision in your stronger eye. They can also useBotox injectionsto weaken the muscle that’s overacting and causing the eye turn. Other potential treatments include: eye exercises corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses surgery on certain eye muscles,......"
What is the long-term outlook for crossed eyes?,"Often crossed eyes can be corrected with corrective lenses, eye patches, surgery in rare cases, or by other modalities. It’s important to seek treatment right away to lower your risk for vision loss. After you’ve received treatment, watch your eyes for changes. In some cases, the condition may come back. If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, early diagnosis and treatment may help improve your chances of recovery. Ask your doctor for more information about your specific condition and treatment options. Last medically reviewed on  August 20, 2019"
What is a doctor of optometry/optometrist?,"Doctors of optometry (O.D.s/optometrists), America’s primary eye health care providers, are the frontline of eye and vision care. Doctors of optometry are essential health care providers and are recognized as physicians under Medicare. They examine, diagnose, treat and manage diseases and disorders of the eye. In addition to providing eye and vision care, they play a major role in an individual’s overall health and well-being by detecting systemic diseases, and diagnosing, treating and managing ocular manifestations of those diseases, and providing vaccinations. Doctors of optometry: Prescribe medications, low vision rehabilitation, vision therapy, spectacle lenses, contact lenses and perform certain surgical............"
What is a comprehensive eye exam?,"Acomprehensive eye examconducted by a doctor of optometry determines the eye and vision health of a patient. During the exam, the doctor checks not only visual acuity through refraction but also the health of your eyes, eye tissue and other diseases. Each patient's symptoms, along with the doctor of optometry’s professional judgment, will determine what tests are conducted."
Why is it important to get comprehensive eye exams with a doctor of optometry?,"An in-person, comprehensive eye exam with a doctor of optometry is the medically recognized standard to assure precise and healthy vision, identify and treat diseases, such as glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In addition, eye exams safeguard overall health by enabling the doctor todetect more than 270 serious health conditionsincluding diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases and cancers. In fact, in 2018 alone, doctors of optometry identified signs of diabetes in more than 301,000 patients who did not know they had the condition. In-person, comprehensive eye exams are one of the most important, preventive ways to preserve vision and..."
What is the difference between a comprehensive eye exam and a vision screening?,"Current vision screening methods cannot be relied on to effectively identify individuals who need vision care. These types of screenings are offered at schools, pediatrician offices or at the DMV. While they may uncover some vision problems, they can miss more than they find. In some cases, vision screenings can give a false sense of security for those individuals who ""pass"" the screening and inhibit the early diagnosis of vision problems. These people are then less likely to receive treatment for their vision problem and it could become worse. A comprehensive eye exam includes a range of tests in order..........................."
Eye Numbing Drops: Why Are They Used and Are They Safe?,"Types Uses Side effects Application and precautions Over-the-counter Summary Medical professionals use eye numbing drops to block the nerves in your eye from feeling pain or discomfort.

Saline drops, artificial tears, and anti-allergy or anti-histamine drops are available over-the-counter to soothe and hydrate your eyes. Antibiotic eye drops......"
Can I buy eye numbing drops over the counter?,"Eye numbing drops are not available over the counter. These drops should only be applied under the supervision of a medical professional to avoid serious side effects and, in some cases,chemical dependency."
How does astigmatism affect my vision?,"Astigmatismis a common vision condition that causes blurriness or distorted vision. It can affect the way light refracts on the retina. On a prescription, this will be written as part of the cylindrical (CYL) correction. If you see no number under CYL, it means you have no astigmatism, or the astigmatism is so slight you don’t need to correct it."
What is 20/20 vision?,"20/20 vision means you have normal visual acuity (or sharpness and clarity) at a distance of 20 feet away. It doesn’t mean perfect vision, though. It only means you can see clearly at a distance. Overall visual ability also measures: peripheral or side vision eye coordination depth of perception focusing ability color vision 20/15 vision is actually better than 20/20. Someone with 20/15 vision can see objects at 20 feet away that someone with 20/20 can only see at 15 feet away. The higher the second number, the less clear and sharp you’ll see objects at a distance. Someone with......"
Will your vision get worse?,"Vision doesn’t worsen as a result of getting older, but your risk for eye-related conditions and diseases does get increase as you age. For example, you’re at a higher risk for the following after age 50: age-relatedmacular degeneration cataracts glaucoma diabetic retinopathy For better eye health, you can try the following in addition to eating ahealthy dietand exercising regularly: wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat when you’re out in bright sunshine wear protective eyewear when playing sports, or using power tools or chemicals maintain ahealthy blood pressure"
How often should you get your eyes checked?,"Your prescription can change, so it’s important to get regular eye exams. Adults ages 19 to 40 with vision problems should get their eyes checked at least every two years. Adults older than 40 should get them checked once a year. If you’re an adult with no vision problems, get your eyes checked every five years until age 30, and then at least every 2 to 4 years from age 40 to 65. After age 65, you’ll need regular eye exams at least every two years. Let your doctor know if you notice any changes to your vision and need......"
How Long Does It Take for the Effects from Eye Dilation Drops to Wear Off?,"Side effects Purpose Tips Eye health Takeaway Getting your eyes dilated is an important part of any complete eye exam. Once your doctor puts in the dilating drops, it takes about 20–30 minutes for your pupils to fully open, or dilate. After your eyes are fully dilated, the effects will last for four to six hours for most people. Some people feel the effects of dilating drops for longer, including people with lighter color eyes. Dilation in children can last up to a full day after the exam. It’s impossible for your doctor to tell you exactly how long the..."
What are the side effects of eye dilation drops?,"Dilation is harmless in the long term, but it does come with short-term side effects. These will usually last for about four to six hours. Side effects of dilation include: light sensitivity blurry vision trouble focusing on close objects stinging right after the drops are put in If you wear contact lenses, you may not be able to wear them until the dilation drops wear off."
Why is eye dilation important?,"Dilation allows an eye doctor to look inside your eyes. Dilating drops widen the pupil (the black part of your eye) so that it doesn’t get smaller when your doctor shines a light at it. The widened pupil allows your doctor to use a magnifying lens to look inside your eye and at the back of your eye. They’ll look at the retina, optic nerve, blood vessels, and other parts of your eye that can’t otherwise be seen. Dilation helps your eye doctor diagnose many eye conditions, including glaucoma retinal detachment age-relatedmacular degeneration diabetic retinopathy It also helps diagnose some..."
What’s the Difference Between PRK and LASIK?,"How they work Recovery Efficacy Risks Candidate Cost Pros and cons Finding a provider Takeaway PRK vs. LASIK Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are both laser surgery techniques used to help improve eyesight. PRK has been around longer, but both are still widely used today. PRK and LASIK are both used to modify thecorneaof your eye. The cornea is made up of five thin, transparent layers of tissue over the front of your eye that bend (or refract) and focus light to help you see. PRK and LASIK each use different methods to help correct your........................"
What happens during LASIK?,"You’re given drops to numb your eye tissues. A small flap is cut into the epithelium using a tool called a femtosecond laser. This allows your surgeon to move this layer to the side while the other layers are reshaped with lasers. Because it remains attached, the epithelium can be put back in its place after the surgery’s done, rather than being fully removed as it is in PRK. An excimer laser is used to reshape corneal tissues and fix any issues with eye curvature. The flap in the epithelium is put back in its place over the rest of..."
What causes your eye to hurt when you blink?,"Common causes for eye pain when you blink include dry eyes, a stye, or pink eye (conjunctivitis). More serious conditions that can cause your eye to hurt when you blink include glaucoma or optic neuritis."
What is an ophthalmologist?,"Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with additional specialist training in the diagnosis and management of disorders of the eye and visual system. They are also sometimes called eye doctors or eye surgeons. In Australia, ophthalmologists need to complete at least 5 years of specialist training after they become a doctor. If you have an eye disease or visual disorder, your doctor or optometrist may refer you to an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologists do surgery and prescribe contact lenses and glasses as well as medicines for eye problems."
What does an ophthalmologist do?,"Ophthalmologists are surgeons, and can do: cataract surgery, in which they replace the lens in your eye refractive or laser surgery, which involves reshaping your cornea to correctshort-sightedness,long-sightednessorastigmatism surgery to correct misalignment of your eyes, orstrabismus surgery to removecancers, such as melanoma, from the eye treatment to repair damage caused by an eye injury"

FIND A HEALTH SERVICE— TheService Findercan help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services."
Do I need a referral to see an ophthalmologist?,"It is important to get areferralfrom your doctor or optometrist to see an ophthalmologist. This is so that they can pass on useful important health information, and the ophthalmologist can later tell the doctor or optometrist about the results of your visit and any tests performed. If you don’t have a referral, neither Medicare nor private health insurance will contribute to the cost of your care. In an emergency, such as an eye injury or sudden loss of vision, go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital immediately, or call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance."
How much will an ophthalmologist cost?,"Thecostsof an ophthalmologist visit vary greatly, depending on the type of care you receive. Factors include whether it’s inhospital, whether you haveprivate health insurance, and what the ophthalmologistcharges."
"Optometrists, orthoptists and ophthalmologists: What’s the difference?","Optometrists are different from ophthalmologists. They can prescribe and fit glasses and contact lenses. They are also trained in screening for serious eye conditions such as glaucoma, but they are not doctors. Optometrists can give advice on visual problems and treat minor eye problems but will refer you to an ophthalmologist for the diagnosis and treatment of more serious eye conditions. Like optometrists, orthoptists are not doctors. They are allied healthcare professionals who specialise in assessing and managing eye movement disorders, such as double vision and squints (strabismus) in children and adults. Their role includes caring for people with eye......"
Why is cataract surgery performed?,"A cataract is an eye condition where the lens of your one or both of your eyes becomes cloudy. Cataractscan make your sight become blurry. If you have cataracts, you may also: be sensitive to bright lights see everything as slightly faded or yellow Cataracts will not get better on their own. The treatment for cataracts is surgery on your affected eye."
Who does cataract surgery?,Cataract surgery is performed by anophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor). Your doctor or optometrist can help you tofind the right health professionalfor cataract treatment.
What happens during cataract surgery?,"On the day of the surgery, you will be given eye drops that include anantibiotic. You might be given an injection around your eye or eye drops to make the eye go numb. Most people have alocal anaesthetic and light sedation. During the procedure you will be asked to lie on your back. The doctor will make a small cut in your eye. This lets them remove your cloudy lens and insert the plastic lens. The operation usually takes less than 30 minutes. There will always be medical staff to talk to during the procedure. If you have any problems,......"

Are there alternatives to cataract surgery?,"During the early stages of cataracts, you may find that new glasses, improved lighting or other visual aids help. If your cataracts start to make everyday activities difficult, surgery is the best treatment."
What is short-sightedness?,"Short-sightedness (also known as myopia) is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred. Someone with myopia can achieve good vision with prescription glasses, contact lenses or laser surgery. Short-sightedness usually first appears in childhood."
How is short-sightedness caused?,"When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) and the lens. If you have normal vision, the light waves are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are short-sighted, the light waves from distant objects focus in front of, rather than on, the retina. Short-sightedness usually appears in the pre-teen years and often gets worse for a few years. It can also develop later — even in early adulthood. It is becoming more common. Myopia has been linked to......"
How is short-sightedness diagnosed?,An eye test using an eye chart will allow an optometrist or ophthalmologist to diagnose short-sightedness. Children should have their vision checked when they start both primary and secondary schools.
How is short-sightedness treated?,"Short-sightedness is usually corrected with prescription glasses. Contact lenses are also an option, but generally not for children.Laser refractive eye surgeryis now also common, but is only appropriate for adults. Some research suggests that certain treatments might be able to slow the progression of short-sightedness in children. If you want to know more about this, talk to your optometrist or doctor. Even if you have no concerns about your vision, it is a good idea to have your eyes checked every 2 years. Learn more here about thedevelopment and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

What is long-sightedness?,"Long-sightedness (also known as hyperopia) is a common eye condition that can be hard to detect. It makes close objects appear blurry, or you might be able to focus clearly but get tired eyes or headaches. For people with significant long-sightedness, vision can be blurry for things in the distance as well."
How is long-sightedness caused?,"The size and shape of the eye largely causes long-sightedness. When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye, and the lens. This process is known as refraction. If you have normal vision, the rays of light are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are long-sighted, the cornea is not sufficiently curved or the eye is too short, so the light rays from close objects focus behind, rather than on, the retina when the eye is resting (not actively............"
How is long-sightedness diagnosed?,"Standard vision screening tests might not detect long-sightedness, but an optometrist or ophthalmologist can measure how well your eye focuses as part of an eye examination."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a commoneyecondition where the cornea or lens in your eye is not perfectly curved. Instead of being shaped like a soccer ball, it is curved like a rugby ball. This means that light entering the eye focuses at 2 places (rather than one) on the retina. This can make your vision mildly or severely blurry. Your ability to see both close up (long-sightedness) and far away (short-sightedness) are affected. There are 2 types of astigmatism: regular —the cornea is curved more in one direction (e.g. vertically) than the other (e.g. horizontally) irregular —the curvature of the cornea is..."
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"Symptoms of astigmatism may include: difficulty focusing blurred vision, both close up (long-sightedness or hyperopia) or far away (short-sightedness or myopia) headaches eyestrain and squinting difficulty seeing at night — you may see halos (spots of light) or glares fatigue ‘lazy eye’in children CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help."

When should I have an eye test?,"You should have an eye test if you experience any trouble with your vision, for example: blurry vision trouble focusing difficulty seeing at night squinting headaches See your optometrist if you suspect your child is having any issues with their sight, or before starting school, to identify any problems early for better vision outcomes. FIND A HEALTH SERVICE— TheService Findercan help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services."
How is astigmatism diagnosed?,"Your optometrist orophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor)can diagnose astigmatism with an eye examination. Testing may include: vision testing to see how clearly you see (visual acuity test) measurement of the curve of your corneas measurement of how well your eyes focus light If you have any concerns about your eyesight, see your optometrist or talk to your doctor."
How is astigmatism treated?,"Your healthcare professional can treat your astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses. Most people have mild astigmatism, and this treatment is enough. If you have severe astigmatism, you may need more extensive treatment with rigid contact lenses or laser eye surgery that can adjust your cornea’s shape."
What is strabismus?,Strabismus (or ‘squint’) is where one of your eyes points in towards your nose (convergent) or out towards your ear (divergent). Sometimes one eye may point up or down. Strabismus may be present all the time or only sometimes.
How does strabismus happen?,"Strabismus in adults can happen because of disease that affects your eye muscles (such as thyroid eye disease and myasthenia), disease that affects the nerves to your eye muscles (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) or trauma (where a physical force is applied directly to your eye). Strabismus can also be caused by trying to correct short- or long-sightedness, or by poor vision in one eye as a result of amblyopia (or ‘lazy eye’). Strabismus may not cause any symptoms. For some people it can be serious."
What is eye cancer?,Eye cancer develops when abnormal cells in your eye grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Many different cancers can affect theeyesor the muscles and tissue around the eye. Eye cancers are sometimes called 'intraocular cancers.'
What are the types of eye cancer?,"If the cancer starts to grow in the eye itself, it is called a primary cancer. If the cancer spreads to the eye (metastasises) from another body part, such as thebreastorlungsit is called a secondary cancer. There are a few different types of primary eye cancer."
What are the symptoms of eye cancer?,"Many people with eye cancer do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may find the condition when you have a routineeye test.If you do have symptoms, you may notice: blurred visionin one eye loss of peripheral vision dark spots on the white or coloured part (iris) of the eye small specks or wavy lines in your vision a change in the shape of the black part of the eye (the pupil) All of these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. But if you are worried, talk to your doctor."
What causes eye cancer?,"Doctors don't fully understand why eye cancer develops, but there are some factors that increase your risk of eye melanoma, including: having light-coloured eyes having pale skin growing older having a lot of moles on your skin having a close relative who has had eye cancer UV radiation from sunlight (or sunlamps) may also increase your risk for melanoma of the eye."
How is eye cancer diagnosed?,"If your doctor thinks you might have eye cancer, they will examine the outside of your eye and use special instruments to look inside it. If you need further tests, your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist called anophthalmologist. The specialist may check your eye using a special microscope, or take photographs of the back of your eye with a special camera. They may also refer you for other tests, including anultrasound. Sometimes, you may have abiopsy, where a small sample of tissue is removed to be checked in a laboratory. You might also have tests such as..."
How is eye cancer treated?,"The type of treatment will depend on the type of eye cancer and how far it has spread (known as itsstage). Usually, you will need surgery to remove the tumour, part of the eye or sometimes the whole eye. After the surgery, you can have an artificial eye implanted, that looks like a real eye. Other treatments may include laser therapy to destroy cancer cells. If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body, your health team may also offer you radiation therapy or other medicines."
What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common eye problem that causes vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve. If untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness. Usually the deterioration in vision is very gradual and not noticeable, so regulareye examinationsare recommended for people from middle age. Once detected, glaucoma can be treated to prevent or delay further vision damage."
What are the types of glaucoma?,"There are several different types of glaucoma. The 2 main types of glaucoma are: open-angle — where fluid pressure builds up in the front part of the eye even when the fluid drainage pathways are open closed-angle (or angle-closure) — where the eye’s fluid drainage pathways are narrowed or closed, so fluid pressure builds up quickly, which may cause pain in the eye and sudden loss of vision Different types of open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma can be categorised as either: primary glaucoma — with an unknown cause; or secondary glaucoma — caused by an eye condition, such as surgery, trauma,......"
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"Most people with glaucoma have few or no symptoms until their eyesight is damaged. If you haveprimary open angle glaucomayou may have no symptoms, or you may lose peripheral vision at first. You might not notice this until there is significant optic nerve damage. If you havechronic angle-closure glaucomayou sometimes get vision problems, such as a halo-like image around lights or you may have no symptoms. If you haveacute angle-closure glaucomayou may get sudden, severe eye pain with nausea and vomiting, headache, watery eyes,blurred vision, and halos around bright lights. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency, and you should seek......"
What causes glaucoma?,"Doctors don’t clearly understand why glaucoma happens. Glaucoma refers to a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve that links theeyeto the brain. The optic nerve carries signals from the back of your eye to the brain and allows you to see. Nerve damage can result from problems with the fluid in the eye. Sometimes, the pressure of the fluid inside the eye rises, and the fluid presses hard on the optic nerve, damaging it. Glaucoma can sometimes occur even when the fluid pressure in the eye is normal."
Who is at risk of glaucoma?,You are at higher risk of developing glaucoma if you: have a close relative with glaucoma have high eye pressure are over 50 areshort-sightedorlong-sighted use (or have used) cortisone (steroid) medications for long periods havediabetesor havehighorlow blood pressure havemigraine headaches have had an eye operation or eye injury
How is glaucoma diagnosed?,"An optometrist orophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor) can detect it early on if you have regulareye examinationsevery 1 to 2 years.

How Does Astigmatism Affect Vision?,"Normally, the cornea and lens at the front of the eye have an evenly round shape. This helps focus light rays sharply onto the retina so you can see clearly. With astigmatism, light rays do not refract (or bend) properly as they enter the front of the eye. Vision is blurry at near and far because light rays either fall short of the retina or behind it.

What Causes a Stye?,"A stye (also called a hordeolum) is a small, red, painful lump that grows from the base of youreyelashor under theeyelid. Most styes are caused by a bacterial infection. There are two kinds of styes: External hordeolum: A stye that begins at the base of your eyelash. Most are caused by an infection in the hair follicle. It might look like a pimple. Internal hordeolum: A stye inside your eyelid. Most are caused by an infection in an oil-producing gland in your eyelid. You can also get a stye if you haveblepharitis. This is a condition that makes your eyelids......"
What Is the Difference Between a Stye and a Chalazion?,"Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between a stye and a chalazion. A stye is very painful. It often appears at the eyelid’s edge, usually caused by an infected eyelash root. It often swells, sometimes affecting the entire eyelid. A chalazion is not usually painful. It is a bump that usually develops farther back on the eyelid than a stye. It is caused by a clogged oil gland. Rarely does it make the entire eyelid swell."
Who Is At Risk for a Stye or a Chalazion?,"Anyone can get a stye or chalazion. But you are even more likely to get one if you have: Blepharitis, a problem that affects the edge of your eyelid Had a stye or chalazion before A skin condition, such as acne rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis Diabetesor other medical problems"

Do ADHD Drugs Increase Glaucoma Risk?,"Researchers tackled this question by looking at healthcare claims from 240,257 people who started using an ADHD drug – either methylphenidate (such as Ritalin), amphetamines (such as Adderall), or atomoxetine (such as Strattera) – between 2010 and 2020. They found that people who used methylphenidate were slightly (1.2 times) more likely than others to develop the most common form of glaucoma, calledopen angle glaucoma.People who used amphetamines or atomoxetine were more than twice as likely than others to developangle closure glaucoma. But just because these two things happen together doesn’t mean one caused the other. It is not clear how........."

How will my eye doctor check for AMD?,"Eye doctors can check for AMD as part of a comprehensive dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for AMD and other eye problems. Your doctor may also recommend doing a test called optical coherence tomography (OCT). In an OCT test, your eye doctor will take pictures of the inside of your eye with a special machine."
How do I live with vision loss from AMD?,"Not everyone with AMD develops late AMD or gets it in both eyes. But if you do, living with vision loss from AMD can be challenging. Having low vision means that even with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery, your vision loss makes it hard to do everyday tasks. The good news is, there are things that can help — like low vision devices and vision rehab services. Vision rehab can help you learn the skills you need to stay independent and active with low vision."
What is amblyopia?,"Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor visionthat usually happens in just 1 eye but less commonly in both eyes. It develops when there’s a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and the brain can’t recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other, stronger eye — while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. It’s called “lazy eye” because the stronger eye worksbetter. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and they can’t control the way their eyes work. Amblyopia starts in childhood, and..."
What are the symptoms of amblyopia?,"Symptoms of amblyopia can be hard to notice. Kids with amblyopia may have poor depth perception — they have trouble telling how near or far something is. Parents may also notice signs that their child is struggling to see clearly, like: Squinting Shutting 1 eye Tilting their head In many cases, parents don’t know their child has amblyopia until a doctor diagnoses it during an eye exam. That’s why it’s important for all kids to get a vision screening at least once between ages 3 and 5."
Is my child at risk for amblyopia?,"Some kids are born with amblyopia and others develop it later in childhood. The chances of having amblyopia are higher in kids who: Were born early (premature) Were smaller than average at birth Have a family history of amblyopia, childhood cataracts, or other eye conditions Have developmental disabilities"
What causes amblyopia?,"In many cases, doctors don’t know the cause of amblyopia. But sometimes, a different vision problem can lead to amblyopia. Normally, the brain uses nerve signals from both eyes to see. But if an eye condition makes vision in 1 eye worse, the brain may try to work around it. It starts to “turn off” signals from the weaker eye and rely only on the stronger eye. Some eye conditions that can lead to amblyopia are: Refractive errors.These include common vision problems like nearsightedness (having trouble seeing far away), farsightedness (having trouble seeing things up close), and astigmatism (which can........."
How will my child’s doctor check for amblyopia?,"As part of a normalvision screening, your child’s doctor will look for signs of amblyopia. All kids ages 3 to 5 need to have their vision checked at least once."
What’s the treatment for amblyopia?,"If there’s a vision problem causing amblyopia, the doctor may treat that first. For example, doctors may recommend glasses or contacts (for kids who are nearsighted or farsighted) or surgery (for kids with cataract). The next step is to re-train the brain and force it to use the weaker eye. The more the brain uses it, the stronger it gets. Treatments include: Wearing an eye patch on the stronger eye.By covering up this eye with a stick-on eye patch (similar to a Band-Aid), the brain has to use the weaker eye to see. Some kids only need to wear the....................."
What is astigmatism?,Astigmatism is a common eye problem that can make your vision blurry or distorted. It happens when your cornea (the clear front layer of your eye) or lens (an inner part of your eye that helps the eye focus) has a different shape than normal. The only way to find out if you have astigmatism is to get an eye exam. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can help you see better — and some people can get surgery to fix their astigmatism.
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,"The most common symptoms of astigmatism are: Blurry vision Needing to squint to see clearly Headaches Eye strain Trouble seeing at night If you have mild astigmatism, you might not notice any symptoms. That’s why it’s important to get regular eye exams — your eye doctor can help you make sure you’re seeing as clearly as possible. This is especially true for children, who may be less likely to realize that their vision isn’t normal."
What causes astigmatism?,"Astigmatism happens when your cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. The shape makes light bend differently as it enters your eye, causing a refractive error. Doctors don’t know what causes astigmatism, and there’s no way to prevent it. Some people are born with astigmatism, but many people develop it as children or young adults. Some people may also develop astigmatism after an eye injury or an eye surgery."
How will my eye doctor check for astigmatism?,Eye doctors can check for astigmatism as part of a dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless.
What's the treatment for astigmatism?,"The most common treatments for astigmatism are eyeglasses orcontact lenses. Your eye doctor will prescribe the right lenses to help you see as clearly as possible. Doctors can also use surgery to treat astigmatism.The surgery changes the shape of your cornea so that it can focus light correctly. If your astigmatism is mild, you may not need treatment. Your eye doctor can help you figure out if you need to get treated, and what type of treatment is best for you. Last updated:November 15, 2023"

Ask if there’s anything you can do to lower your risk."
What causes cataracts?,"Most cataracts happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. When you’re young, the lens in your eye is clear. Around age 40, the proteins in the lens of your eye start to break down and clump together. This clump makes a cloudy area on your lens — known as a cataract. Over time, the cataract gets worse and makes more of your lens cloudy."
How can I prevent cataracts?,"You can take steps to protect your eyes from cataracts: Protect your eyes from the sun.Wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block the sun. Protect your eyes from injury.While doing activities like using power tools or playing certain sports, wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from getting accidentally injured. Quit smoking.If you’re ready to quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for free support. Make eye-healthy food choices.Eat plenty of healthy foods — like fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains."
How will my eye doctor check for cataracts?,"An eye doctor can check for cataracts as part of a dilated eye exam. If you’re age 60 or older, get a dilated eye exam every 1 to 2 years. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for cataracts and other eye problems."

What causes color vision deficiency?,"Most people who have color vision deficiency are born with it. This is because the most common types of color vision deficiency are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parents. Color vision deficiency can also happen because of an injury to the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye), the optic nerve (which connects the eye to the brain), or the brain itself.Some examples of injuries that can lead to color vision deficiency are: Retinal detachment(when the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of the eye) Eye injuries caused by............"

What is presbyopia?,Presbyopia is a refractive error that makes it hard for middle-aged and older adults to see things up close. It happens because the lens (an inner part of the eye that helps the eye focus) stops focusing light correctly on the retina (a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). Presbyopia is a normal part of aging. Everyone gets presbyopia as they get older — usually after age 45. Many people have another refractive error in addition to presbyopia.
What are the symptoms of presbyopia?,"Symptoms of presbyopia include: Trouble seeing things up close Needing to hold reading materials farther away to focus on them Eye strain (when your eyes feel tired or sore) Headache Presbyopia gets worse over time, but it usually stops getting worse after age 65."
What causes presbyopia?,"As you age, the lens in your eye gets harder and less flexible, and it stops focusing light correctly on the retina. This makes nearby objects look blurry.

What are the stages of ROP?,There are 5 different stages of ROP. Doctors use these stages to keep track of how serious ROP is. The stages range from stage 1 (mild) to stage 5 (severe): Stages 1 and 2— Babies in these stages usually get better without treatment and go on to have healthy vision. Doctors will watch babies carefully to see if their ROP gets worse. Stage 3— Some babies who develop stage 3 get better with no treatment and go on to have healthy vision. But others need treatment to stop abnormal blood vessels from damaging the retina and causing retinal detachment (an...............
What are the symptoms of ROP?,"There are no signs of ROP that you can see. In advanced cases of ROP, the retina may partially or completely pull away from its normal position at the back of the eye. This is called retinal detachment — and it can cause vision loss and blindness.

What causes ROP?,"Normally, the blood vessels of the retina start to develop in the fourth month of pregnancy and finish developing around the due date, or 9 months of pregnancy. If a baby is born very early, these blood vessels may stop developing normally. The retina then develops new blood vessels that are abnormal. This is called retinal neovascularization, or NV. These abnormal blood vessels can grow in the wrong direction. The blood vessels are attached to the retina — so if they grow too far in the wrong direction, they can pull the retina up off the back of the eye...."
How will my baby’s doctor check for ROP?,"If your baby is at risk for ROP, they’ll need a dilated eye exam a few weeks after they’re born — usually between 4 to 9 weeks after birth.

What causes retinal detachment?,"There are many causes of retinal detachment, but the most common causes are aging or an eye injury. There are 3 types of retinal detachment: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative. Each type happens because of a different problem that causes your retina to move away from the back of your eye."
How can I prevent retinal detachment?,"Since retinal detachment is often caused by aging, there’s often no way to prevent it. But you can lower your risk of retinal detachment from an eye injury by wearing safety goggles or other protective eye gear when doing risky activities, like playing sports.

What Is Adult Strabismus?,"Adult strabismus (crossed eyes) is when your eyes are not lined up properly and they point in different directions. One eye may look straight ahead while the other eye turns in, out, up, or down. The misalignment can shift from one eye to the other.Strabismus affects vision, since both eyes must aim at the same spot together to see properly.There Are Six Eye Muscles That Control Eye MovementOne muscle moves the eye to the right, and one muscle moves the eye to the left. The other four muscles move the eye up, down, and at an angle. In order to........."
What Causes Adult Strabismus (Crossed Eyes)?,"To line up and focus both eyes on a single target, all muscles in both eyes must be balanced and working together. The brain controls these muscles. People who have strabismus usually have a problem that can affect eye muscles. Some of those problems may include: Health problems such asdiabetes,thyroid eye disease(or TED, also known as Graves’ eye disease), Myasthenia gravis, brain tumors, or a stroke Accidents or head injury Damage to eye muscles during some kind of eye surgery Most adults with strabismus have had it since they were children. But sometimes it starts later in life."
How Does Adult Strabismus Affect Vision?,"With normal vision, both eyes aim at the same spot. The brain combines the two images from our eyes into a single, three-dimensional (3-D) image. This is how we can tell how near or far something is from us (called depth perception). When one eye is out of alignment, two different pictures are sent to the brain.In a young child, the brain learns to ignore the image of the misaligned eye. Instead, it sees only the image from the straight or better-seeing eye. As a result, the child loses depth perception. Adults who develop strabismus after childhood often havedouble vision...."
What Are the Symptoms of Adult Strabismus (Crossed Eyes)?,"The most obvious symptom is having eyes that appear out of alignment. Adults with strabismus also may notice these other symptoms: Weakness in or around the eye, or feeling like something is pulling around your eyes. Vision changes, such as double vision (seeing two of one image), blurry vision, trouble reading, or a loss of depth perception. Constantly tilting or turning your head to see an image clearly. Strabismus symptoms can be constant, or they can come and go."
What Is an After-Cataract?,"After cataract surgery, your vision can become cloudy due to what is known as an after-cataract.

What Is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the part of your eye that carries information defining what you see to your brain. Your brain then turns the information into images. Though there are probably several factors that contribute to glaucoma, the one we understand the best is eye pressure. With glaucoma, fluid builds up in your eye and increases pressure. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve over time. Without treatment, optic nerve damage can cause vision loss and eventual blindness. Around..."

What Is LASIK?,"LASIK uses laser technology to precisely reshape the cornea, which treats vision problems in people who have nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism, or a combination of these conditions. LASIK allows many patients have their vision restored up to, or better than, 20/20."
How Does LASIK Work?,"LASIK uses a precise femtosecond laser to create a flap from the top layer of the cornea. The flap is gently folded back, then an Excimer laser uses cool ultraviolet light to sculpt the mid cornea under a protective layer of tissue. Once your surgeon repositions the flap, the procedure is complete. Since the surface cells of your eyes heal more quickly than any other body part, visual recovery usually occurs within 24 hours and there is minimal discomfort after surgery."
Will I Be Awake? Does LASIK Hurt?,"You will be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb your eyes with a topical anesthetic to limit discomfort. After surgery, you can use over-the-counter pain medications."
"What if I Can’t Keep my Eye Open During Surgery, or if I Move my Head?",We use a device to keep your eye open during the procedure. This device is a lid holder that gently holds your lids open during the procedure. Our physicians will make sure you are positioned correctly. The laser also tracks your eye throughout the procedure to adjust to your movements.

WHAT ARE CATARACTS?,"Cataract Surgery Understanding Cataracts Femtosecond Laser Intraocular Lens Treatment A cataract is a thickening and hardening of the lens in the eye. As the lens in your eye thickens, the naturally transparent lens becomes clouded or opaque. In its early stages, a cataract may not cause a problem; the cloudiness may affect only a small part of the lens. However, as the cataract grows larger it prevents light from reaching your retina. As less light reaches your retina, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and vision may become dull and blurry."
What Causes Corneal Infections?,"Corneal infections can be caused by many things. Sometimes the cornea is damaged after a foreign object has penetrated the tissue, maybe from a poke in the eye. Bacteria or fungi from a contaminated contact lens can also pass into the cornea. These things can cause painful inflammation and corneal infections called keratitis. Keratitis can reduce visual clarity, produce corneal discharges, and possibly erode the cornea.

Are Eye Styes Caused by Stress?,"Styes are not caused by stress, diet, or hygiene."
Why Do I Keep Getting Styes?,Recurrent styes may be due to chronic conditions such as blepharitis (clogged oil ducts) or rosacea. Your ophthalmologist can help determine any underlying causes and recommend the correct treatment.
Are Styes Contagious?,"Styes are not contagious. However, in rare instances, bacteria may spread between others if common items like towels or pillowcases are shared."
How Long Does a Stye Last?,Many styes heal within a few days and can be easily treated at home. See your eye care specialist if your stye lasts more than two to three weeks.
Can You Pop a Stye When It Comes to a Head?,We do not recommend trying to pop or drain a stye on your own. Improperly popping a stye can lead to further infection or inflammation.
What Is Electrophysiology?,"Electrophysiology is used to diagnose and follow progression of disorders affecting vision similar to the manner electrocardiograms (ECGs) are used to monitor heart disease. The retina of the eye, optic pathways in the brain and visual cortex create electrical signals that can be recorded directly from the eye or extracted by computer from brain electrical signals recorded from the scalp, similar to recording electroencephalograms (EEG). Moran Eye Center electrophysiologists are leaders in the field and are actively involved in research to improve electrophysiological testing."
Are There Different Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma Symptoms & Causes Types of Glaucoma Glaucoma Treatment Not all glaucoma cases are the same. There are actually several types of glaucoma, and your treatment will depend on what type of glaucoma you have."
What Are Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments?,"Since the procedure is used to flatten a steep cornea, nearsighted patients benefit the most. The level of nearsightedness should be mild, and the patients should have little or no astigmatism. The advantage of this procedure is that the ring segments can be removed or exchanged. INTACS are also used as a treatment for keratoconus patients."
What Is Strabismus?,"Strabismus is a common eye-movement disorder where the eyes are not aligned correctly. Either one or both eyes may turn inward, outward, up, or down, which is why strabismus is also called wandering eye or cross eyes. In most cases strabismus is caused by abnormal neuromuscular control of eye movement. Strabismus can also be caused by poor muscle strength."
What Is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that causes eye problems. It damages the blood vessels inside the retina and can cause blurred vision, vision floaters, and difficulty seeing colors. If left untreated, it can cause blindness."
What Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?,"Age-related macular degeneration, also called AMD, is the deterioration of the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is the part of the retina which is responsible for our central vision and our ability to see color and fine detail when looking directly at an object. AMD is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 55. In the early stages of AMD, there is little or no vision loss. As the disease advances, images can become blurred, distorted, or a dark or empty area can appear in the center of the vision......."
What is Retinal Detachment?,"The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts visual images into nerve impulses in the brain. Injuries to the eye can cause layers of the retina to separate, which is known as a retinal detachment. Any portion of the retina that is detached cannot send visual signals to the brain. If left untreated, retinal detachment can cause blindness. A retinal detachment is considered an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Anyone who has experienced trauma to the eye should see an ophthalmologist who can perform a dilated eye exam. Blunt eye trauma can..."
Can I do anything about the risk of vision loss?,"Remind family members and friends at higher risk for eye diseases and vision loss to have their eyes examined regularly. It's estimated that half ofvisual impairment and blindnesscan be prevented through early diagnosis and treatment. Although there are cost-effective treatment options to prevent vision loss, cases of potentially blinding eye diseases are increasing. Increased awareness can help."
What causes vision loss for people over 40 years old?,"The major eye diseases among people 40 years and older are diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The number of people with blindness and vision loss increases with age in all racial and ethnic groups."
What should I know about diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathyis the leading cause of blindness among working-age (ages 20–74) Americans. It's caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. With early diagnosis and treatment, you can prevent vision loss. People with diabetes should have a dilated eye exam each year, but only about two thirds follow this guideline. Managing diabetes including blood sugar level, blood pressure, and cholesterol control can prevent or delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy."
What should I know about cataracts?,"Cataractsare a major cause of vision loss, especially among Americans aged 40 years and older. Cataracts risk factors include age, diabetes, smoking, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. Cataract surgery can restore vision. This surgery is highly cost-effective; however, among Black Americans, cataracts is the main cause of blindness."
What should I know about age-related macular degeneration?,"Americans aged 50 years and older have a higher risk of developingage-related macular degeneration (AMD). Treatment with zinc and antioxidants has been shown to prevent or delay progression to advanced AMD in this age group. The greatest risk factor is age; however, other risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history, race (White), and gender (female). Eating healthy, being physically active, and avoiding smoking can reduce the risk of AMD."
What should I know about glaucoma?,"Glaucomacan be managed to prevent or delay vision loss with early detection and timely treatment. Nevertheless, half of all people with glaucoma are not diagnosed. Glaucoma is the number-one disease that causes blindness among Black Americans. People with a higher risk for glaucoma are: Black adults ages 40 and older. Everyone over age 60. Mexican American adults. People with a family history of glaucoma. People with a high risk of glaucoma should have a dilated eye exam every two years by an eye care professional."
What should I know about amblyopia (lazy eye)?,"Amblyopia(or lazy eye) is the most common cause of vision loss among children. It affects 2 to 3 out of 100 children. If it is not treated timely and properly, it can stay through adulthood. It is a very common cause of vision loss in one eye among children and young adults."
Who is at higher risk for glaucoma?,"Members of some racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk of developing glaucoma. For example: A 2016 study found that 81% of glaucoma cases among Hispanic or Latino people are undiagnosed and untreated compared to 73% in non-Hispanic White people.4By the year 2050, it is expected that 50% of all glaucoma patients in the United States will be Hispanic people.4 Glaucoma is six times more common among Black or African American people than White people.3 Other risk factors for glaucoma1include: Being age 60 or older. Having a family history of glaucoma. Having diabetes or high blood pressure."
What eye problems can diabetes cause?,"Over time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which canharm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss andretinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from............"

But your risk of developing it is higher if you: Have had diabetes for a long time Don't have good control over your high blood sugar orhigh blood pressure Arepregnant Havehigh blood cholesterol Smoke tobacco
What are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?,"In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilatedeye examsare so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy. You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could mean an emergency. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters) Flashes of light A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain Vision loss Eye pain or redness Talk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if they come and..............."
How are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?,Eye doctors do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your doctor can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. Your doctor will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.
What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?,"Treatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include: Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye But these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep yourblood pressureandcholesterolin a healthy......"
What are Cataracts?,"DownloadPDF Copy Cataracts are whitish or cloudy patches that develop in a person’s eye lens and lead to blurred or clouded vision. Cataracts are the most common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Cataracts can develop in one or both eyes and interrupt the flow of light through the lens. The lens is usually transparent, allowing light to pass though to the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts, however, cause the lens to become opaque and as the cataracts grow in size or number, vision gradually worsens, as less light is able to penetrate the lens."
How Does the Eye Work?,"DownloadPDF Copy The human eye is a wonder of engineering. It consists of many different parts that work together to provide visual information to the brain, which then translates it into information that is useful to the body."
What is Diabetic Retinopathy?,"DownloadPDF Copy Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of long-standing diabetes that affects vision. It describes damage to the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for transmitting nerve impulses to the visual centres in the brain via the optic nerve. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a persistenthigh blood sugarlevel. This can eventually damage the small blood vessels that supply the retina with nutrients and oxygen. The retina is then starved of vital nutrients as well as being potentially exposed to leakage from the damaged blood vessels which can blur vision. Without treatment, diabetic retinopathy..."
What is Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is among the leading cause of permanent vision loss in most regions of the world. Damage to the optic nerve fibers resulting from glaucoma causes optic nerve cupping, which results in loss of vision and in some cases requires the removal of the eye."
What is a retinal break?,"About 80% of the eye is filled with a gel-like vitreous body, which gives the eye its round contour. This is crisscrossed by millions of very fine connective tissue fibers, which are attached more or less loosely to the retinal surface. In most patients, the vitreous humor contracts with age. In areas where the fibers are firmly attached, the retina tears due to the pulling away of the vitreous. This creates a retinal hole. Thus, retinal breaks are holes in the retina that occur mostly when the vitreous body in front of the retina contracts and tugs on it. This........................"
Should You Seek Help for Eye Floaters?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye floaters are shadows of the cell strands that are present in the vitreous of the eye. Though many floaters do not cause harm to the affected individual, there are some conditions in which an individual should seek physician help, as floaters in these situations could indicate benign diseases. Some floaters can also be a sign of vision-threatening diseases. When the disease is diagnosed and treated, it can restore eye health and also cure floaters."
What are the Types of Glaucoma?,"Glaucoma actually refers to a group of disorders. Open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma are the two major types of glaucoma. Both the types are characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), or pressure inside the eye."
What is the Most Common Form of Glaucoma?,"Open-angle glaucoma, the most common formofglaucoma, is caused by blockageof the trabecular meshwork or drainage canals. The “open-angle” designation refers to the preservation of a wide and open angle between the iris and cornea. The condition develops slowly over a lifetime, and symptoms are gradual and often go unnoticed. Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by an imbalance in the production and drainage of aqueous humor (eye fluid). Blockageof drainage canals causes fluid accumulation in the eye chamber, which in turn causes increased IOP. Vision loss from this type is first evident peripherally, then moves centrally."
What are Aberrations of the Eye?,DownloadPDF Copy The human eye can be affected by a number of aberrations which can reduce the quality of retinal images and general visual perception. Research has shown that age increases the probability of developing higher order aberrations in particular.
What are Aberrations of the Eye?,"Described as small optical irregularities, aberrations are imperfections of the eye that result in light being unable to focus onto the retina effectively as well as defects in visual image. There are two types of aberrations; lower-order aberrations (0, 1st and 2nd order), and higher-order aberrations (3rd,4th…)."
What Causes Eye Floaters?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye floaters (myodesopsias) emerge as a consequence of opacities developed in the vitreous fluid of the eye. The fibers in the vitreous create shadows on the retina and these shadows are called floaters. Based on the size and shape of the fibers, floaters may appear as black spots, thread-like, or a small piece of cobweb. When the eye moves, these fibers move in the vitreous fluid and become visible. Floaters are dark or semi-transparent and are visible while staring at a surface that is light-colored or when exposed to bright light. When we try to look at a......"
What Does an Optometrist Do?,"DownloadPDF Copy Optometrists are self-reliant superior healthcare specialists, who are licensed to detect, diagnose, and provide treatment for diseases and disorders related to the eyes and the visual system. Optometrists were formerly known as ophthalmic opticians.  They performed all the work that was performed by ophthalmologists, except surgery. Optometrists work in hospitals, clinics, the ophthalmic industry, teaching institutions, and on research projects; however, they majorly contribute their services in clinical practice, hospitals, and public health centers."
What is eye cancer?,"DownloadPDF Copy Eye cancer, as the name suggests begins in the eye. The eye is composed of various smaller structures each of which can be affected. A cancer or tumor is basically an uncontrolled growth of any particular cell or group of cells. This tumor may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancerous tumors are fast growing, fast spreading and may be fatal if not treated. Eye cancers like other eye diseases are treated by Ophthalmologists and oncologists (cancer specialists)."
What is LASIK?,"DownloadPDF Copy LASIK is a surgical procedure where the cornea of the eye is reshaped in order to reduce a person’s dependency on glasses or contact lenses. The acronym LASIK stands forLaserInSituKeratomileusis because an excimer laser (a type of ultraviolet laser) is used. It is similar to other corrective procedures such as photorefractive keratectomy but provides several additional benefits – primarily a quicker recovery period. Image Credit: BLACKDAY/Shutterstock.com Like any other procedure, the results of LASIK surgery are determined on the basis of certain parameters that includeefficacy, predictability, stability, safety and patient satisfaction. It is crucial that the surgeon evaluates..."
What is Normal-Tension Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, develops slowly and has symptoms that often go unnoticed. Raised IOP is a hallmark of most forms on glaucoma. However, in certain conditions, optic nerve damage may occur even when the IOP is below the normal level of 21 mm Hg. This form of glaucoma is commonly referred to as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). NTG is associated with glaucomatous optic nerve damage, progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fiber, and visual field defects."
What are the risk factors for normal tension glaucoma?,"Some factors that predispose persons to increased risk of developing NTG are Family history of NTG - The TANK-binding kinase 1 gene has been found to be associated with NTG development. Japanese ancestry –The condition occurs most commonly among Japanese persons. Persons with a history of heart disease such as irregular heart rhythm, vascular dysfunction and ischemia. Female patients – The condition is more prevalent in females than male. Persons with hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance."
How is normal-tension glaucoma diagnosed?,"Medical history A complete medical history is taken with special emphasis on history of head injury. Past episodes of migraine, shock, neurological symptoms, and Raynaud's phenomenon are also investigated. The doctor may also inquire regarding the use of medications such as systemic steroids and beta blockers. Visualizing the optic nerve damage"
How is normal-tension glaucoma treated?,"As per the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study Group, an IOP reduction of 30% can help to slow the progression of normal-tension glaucoma. Doctors treat normal tension glaucoma by using pharmacologic agents, laser treatment, or conventional surgery. Pharmacologic agents, such as prostaglandin analogs, alpha-2 agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and miotics are normally used. Surgery is an option if medications fail to achieve the target IOP or if the patient is non-adherent to treatment. Deep sclerectomy, laser trabeculoplasty, and filtration surgery are safe and effective options. They are recommended in patients who show disease progression despite maximum tolerated medical therapy. Another........."
What is Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is an irreversible optic neuropathy characterised by peripheral visual loss that usually precedes central vision loss. Due to its chronic nature and lack of early indicators of disease progression, OAG is a major health concern worldwide."
How does Open-Angle Glaucoma develop?,"Glaucoma, is characterised by an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The trabecular meshwork is a specialized region in the eye that adjusts the IOP by regulating the aqueous humor outflow from the eye. In OAG, this meshwork is blocked, and an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor results. The accumulation of aqueous humor in the eye chamber increases the IOP to a level that leads to optic neuropathy. The exact pathogenesis of optic neuropathy is not known. However, following are the two main proposed mechanisms: Vascular dysfunction – Which results in ischemia or an inadequate blood supply to the......"
What are the risk factors for the development of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"OAG is most common in individuals who have a previous history of elevated IOP. African-Americans, elderly persons, and those with a family history of glaucoma are more at risk. Smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, anxiety, stress, and sleep apnea may also increase the risk of OAG. Elevated IOP is the most readily treatable risk factor."
What are the symptoms of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"The condition is asymptomatic in the initial stages, and patients do not present with any complaints until late in the course of the disease. Vision loss from this type begins peripherally and  gradually moves to the center. Due to the silent and progressive nature of OAG, clinical evaluation is warranted in individuals at high risk."
What are the screening options for Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"In asymptomatic patients younger than 40 years, screening is recommended every three to five years. However, in African Americans, persons older than 40 years, and those with multiple risk factors, screening is recommended more frequently. Screening usually includes a complete medical history, eye examination using a gonioscope, binocular views of the optic discs, and a quantitative visual field test."
What is the Management of Open-Angle Glaucoma?,"With timely screening and treatment, glaucoma can be identified at an early stage and its progress can be halted before the disease significantly affects vision. The main goal is to reduce IOP before the disease progresses to cause complete vision loss. Drugs used to treat open-angle glaucoma include alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, miotics, and prostaglandin analogs. The treatment strategy usually involves taking into consideration the risk factors, adverse effects related to the drug use, the patient’s life expectancy, medical history, and concomitant conditions. Surgery is the next option in cases where IOP worsens even after administration of the maximum..."
What is Traumatic Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Among young people, ocular injuries are common and comprise an important cause of preventable visual morbidity. Although ocular trauma is common, many injuries are minor and do not require hospital admission. However, it should be noted that certain ocular injuries are serious and potentially fatal. Certain forms of ocular trauma can manifest later as secondary glaucoma, also known as traumatic glaucoma. Traumatic glaucoma is clinically defined as a post-traumatic rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) more than 21 mm Hg. Traumatic glaucoma can develop due to blunt trauma or injuries that bruise the eye; however, some forms are caused..."
What causes traumatic glaucoma?,"Elevated IOP following trauma results from a multitude of factors. Drainage impairment may occur at the trabecular meshwork due to injury and hyphema, a pooling of blood inside the anterior chamber of the eye. Injury and inflammation to the lens or iris can also lead to the development of traumatic glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) may also develop. These adhesions between the peripheral iris and the angular structures of the anterior chamber reduce outflow of aqueous humor (eye fluid), resulting in increased intraocular pressure."
What are the signs and symptoms of traumatic glaucoma?,"Aching pain in the eye – This may occur immediately after the injury Light sensitivity Blurred vision Blood collection (hyphema) and inflammation in the eye Elevated eye pressure –due to the blockage of the eye canals with blood and inflammatory cells Pain may subside after the resolution of hyphema and inflammation, but the eye pressure may remain elevated. Although painless, increased IOP can cause significant damage to the optic nerve. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a long time until the visual loss has progressed to an advanced stage."
How is traumatic glaucoma diagnosed?,"Doctors usually start by carrying out a complete eye examination to assess the extent of the damage. After confirming that the eye is not ruptured, the doctor examines the IOP and the angle structures. The angle structures are measured using a slit lamp microscope and a gonioscope. Imaging can also be done performed with ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). If the optic nerve show signs of glaucoma, the following additional tests are carried out. Optic nerve thickness measurements Visual field testing and screening for early visual field loss"
How is traumatic glaucoma treated?,The treatment goal for all forms of glaucoma is lowering IOP to less than 21 mm Hg. The pressure should be lowered in such a way that the optic nerve is not further damaged.
What is Glaucoma?,"DownloadPDF Copy Glaucoma is a common ocular condition whereby damage is caused to the optic nerve connecting the eye to the brain. Image Credit: Olena Yakobchuk/Shutterstock.com It is considered to be the second greatest factor causing permanent blindness in the US and typically affects aging adults. Generally, glaucoma is referred to as an acquired loss of axons of the optic nerve and ganglion cells of the retina or optic neuropathy which leads to progressive vision loss. The condition can affect both eyes, yet, progression may differ between each eye, meaning glaucoma may be worse in one eye. One of the............"
How is Glaucoma Diagnosed?,"Adults and children are recommended to have routine eye tests, which can detect the early signs of glaucoma. Vision tests and the measurement of your eye’s internal pressures are often used by an optometrist to check for glaucoma. If the test results are indicative of glaucoma, then a referral to an ophthalmologist is often made. As there are no current guidelines on preventing glaucoma, most suggest having regular eye tests in order to detect the condition as early as possible to prevent rapid progression."
What Causes Retinal Detachment?,"DownloadPDF Copy The retina is the layer of the eye that contains light-sensitive nerve cells or photoreceptors. It receives and transmits light stimuli to the brain, enabling the body to see. It lines the inside of the eye, resting upon a pigmented layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This nourishes and renews the retinal photopigments, maintaining normal visual function. When the retina pulls away from the underlying RPE it is called a retinal detachment."
