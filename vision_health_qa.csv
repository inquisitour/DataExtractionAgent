Question,Answer
Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: What’s the Difference?,"An optometrist treats your eyes. In contrast, an ophthalmologist focuses on doing surgical procedures for eye conditions, while an optician helps you fit eyeglasses and other vision-correcting devices. If you’ve ever had to search for an eye care doctor, you’re likely aware that there are several different types of eye specialists. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians are all professionals who specialize in eye care. In this article, we will explore the education requirements, salary, scope of practice, and services that optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians provide. We will also discuss how to choose the best eye-care professional for your needs."
What is an optometrist and what do they do?,An optometrist is the primary health care provider for routine eye care.
What is an ophthalmologist and what do they do?,An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in surgical eye procedures.
What Are the Job Duties of an Optometrist?,"When someone starts having vision trouble, they see an optometrist for basic vision care. Optometrists do routine vision checks and tests, examine other parts of the visual system and diagnose and treat minor eye problems, diseases and injuries. If necessary, the optometrist prescribes glasses or contact lenses, finding the right vision correction level and fit for each person. They also do minor surgical procedures, offer pre- and post-op care for more involved surgeries with an ophthalmologist and promote general eye health and care."
How Do the Job Duties of an Ophthalmologist Differ From an Optometrist?,"Ophthalmologists can do all the above duties that optometrists can, as well as perform eye surgery. They have the additional skills to specialize in surgery for conditions like glaucoma and cataracts. They also perform corneal, vitro-retinal, eye muscle and oculoplastic surgeries. Before surgery even takes place, the ophthalmologist puts the patient through a complete exam to diagnose the issue and create the best treatment plan. An ophthalmologist can also treat more complicated eye injuries, including those dealing with other eye structures like the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva and eyelids."
Where Do Optometrists and Ophthalmologists Work?,"Many optometrists own their practices, sometimes working in a practice with other optometrists. Some optometrists only work with a certain population, specializing in one type of eye care such as pediatrics or low vision. Optometrists also find employment in postsecondary education, as consultants and in research roles. Ophthalmologists work in mostly in hospitals and surgery centers, but some also have their own practices. Both generally work full-time, putting in hours in the evenings and on the weekends to fit patient schedules."
What Is the Average Optometrist Salary?,"According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for optometrists was$110,300, as of May 2017. This means that half of the industry made more and half made less. Those in the top 10 percent of earners made$190,090, while the bottom 10 percent brought home less than$53,740. Optometrists employed in private doctor practices made the most at$124,060, while those in government roles made the least at$94,280. These states have the highest averageeye doctor salary:"
What Is the Average Ophthalmologist Salary?,"Ophthalmologists earn an average of$357,000a year, according to the Medscape Ophthalmologist Compensation Report from 2018. The salary for self-employed ophthalmologists is$429,000, higher than the salary for those working for other entities, which is an average of$256,000. More years of experience generally equals higher pay. Those with 0 to 5 years of experience earn an average of$180,000, while 20-plus years of experience gets you about$270,000a year."
What Are the Symptoms of Glaucoma?,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision. Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:"
What Causes Glaucoma?,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye. What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe..."
What Are the Types of Glaucoma?,Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are:
Who Is at Risk of Glaucoma?,"According to theWorld Health Organization(WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include:"
How Is Glaucoma Diagnosed?,"To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They’ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures:"
How Is Glaucoma Treated?,"The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don’t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments:"
Will a Person with Glaucoma Go Blind?,"If your increased IOP can be stopped and the pressure returned to normal, vision loss can be slowed or even stopped. However, because there’s no cure for glaucoma, you’ll likely need treatment for the rest of your life to regulate your IOP. Unfortunately, vision lost as a result of glaucoma cannot be restored."
Can Glaucoma Be Prevented?,"Glaucoma can’t be prevented, but it’s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss. Last medically reviewed on  January 29, 2016"
What causes crossed eyes?,"Crossed eyes occur either due to nerve damage or when the muscles around your eyes don’t work together because some are weaker than others. When your brain receives a different visual message from each eye, it ignores the signals coming from your weaker eye. If your condition isn’t corrected, you may lose vision in your weaker eye. Crossed eyes are common in children. Often the underlying cause is unknown. Infantile esotropia is a type of crossed eyes that appears in babies during their first year of life. Esotropia runs in families and usually requires surgery to correct. Acquired esotropia occurs......"
How is crossed eyes diagnosed?,"To prevent vision loss, early diagnosis and treatment for crossed eyes is important. If you develop symptoms of crossed eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor. They’ll perform a series of tests to check the health of your eyes that may include: If you have other physical symptoms along with crossed eyes, your doctor may examine your brain and nervous system for other conditions. For example, they may conduct tests to check for cerebral palsy orGuillain-Barré syndrome. It’s common for newborn babies to have crossed eyes. If your baby has crossed eyes that persist beyond 3 months of age,..."
Who is at risk of crossed eyes?,You’re more likely to develop crossed eyes if you:
How are crossed eyes treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan for crossed eyes will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your condition. If your crossed eyes have resulted from a lazy eye, your doctor may have you wear a patch over your stronger eye to force the muscles of your weaker eye to work harder. Your doctor might also prescribe eye drops to blur the vision in your stronger eye. They can also useBotox injectionsto weaken the muscle that’s overacting and causing the eye turn. Other potential treatments include: If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, such as abrain tumoror..."
What is the long-term outlook for crossed eyes?,"Often crossed eyes can be corrected with corrective lenses, eye patches, surgery in rare cases, or by other modalities. It’s important to seek treatment right away to lower your risk for vision loss. After you’ve received treatment, watch your eyes for changes. In some cases, the condition may come back. If your crossed eyes are caused by an underlying medical condition, early diagnosis and treatment may help improve your chances of recovery. Ask your doctor for more information about your specific condition and treatment options. Last medically reviewed on  August 20, 2019"
What is a doctor of optometry/optometrist?,"Doctors of optometry (O.D.s/optometrists), America’s primary eye health care providers, are the frontline of eye and vision care. Doctors of optometry are essential health care providers and are recognized as physicians under Medicare. They examine, diagnose, treat and manage diseases and disorders of the eye. In addition to providing eye and vision care, they play a major role in an individual’s overall health and well-being by detecting systemic diseases, and diagnosing, treating and managing ocular manifestations of those diseases, and providing vaccinations. Doctors of optometry: More than 30,000 doctors of optometry nationwide are available to provide high-quality eye health and..."
What is a comprehensive eye exam?,"Acomprehensive eye examconducted by a doctor of optometry determines the eye and vision health of a patient. During the exam, the doctor checks not only visual acuity through refraction but also the health of your eyes, eye tissue and other diseases. Each patient's symptoms, along with the doctor of optometry’s professional judgment, will determine what tests are conducted."
Why is it important to get comprehensive eye exams with a doctor of optometry?,"An in-person, comprehensive eye exam with a doctor of optometry is the medically recognized standard to assure precise and healthy vision, identify and treat diseases, such as glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In addition, eye exams safeguard overall health by enabling the doctor todetect more than 270 serious health conditionsincluding diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases and cancers. In fact, in 2018 alone, doctors of optometry identified signs of diabetes in more than 301,000 patients who did not know they had the condition. In-person, comprehensive eye exams are one of the most important, preventive ways to preserve vision and..."
What is the difference between a comprehensive eye exam and a vision screening?,"Current vision screening methods cannot be relied on to effectively identify individuals who need vision care. These types of screenings are offered at schools, pediatrician offices or at the DMV. While they may uncover some vision problems, they can miss more than they find. In some cases, vision screenings can give a false sense of security for those individuals who ""pass"" the screening and inhibit the early diagnosis of vision problems. These people are then less likely to receive treatment for their vision problem and it could become worse. A comprehensive eye exam includes a range of tests in order......"
Eye Numbing Drops: Why Are They Used and Are They Safe?,"Medical professionals use eye numbing drops to block the nerves in your eye from feeling pain or discomfort. If you’re pregnant or nursing, tell your doctor before getting eye numbing drops. Eye numbing drops are considered atopical anesthetic. They’re used duringeye examsand for surgical procedures involving your eyes. It’s important to understand the distinction between eye numbing drops (used for surgical procedures and eye exams) and other types ofeye drops. Saline drops, artificial tears, and anti-allergy or anti-histamine drops are available over-the-counter to soothe and hydrate your eyes. Antibiotic eye drops are available by prescription to treat eye injuries, likecorneal......"
Can I buy eye numbing drops over the counter?,"Eye numbing drops are not available over the counter. These drops should only be applied under the supervision of a medical professional to avoid serious side effects and, in some cases,chemical dependency."
How does astigmatism affect my vision?,"Astigmatismis a common vision condition that causes blurriness or distorted vision. It can affect the way light refracts on the retina. On a prescription, this will be written as part of the cylindrical (CYL) correction. If you see no number under CYL, it means you have no astigmatism, or the astigmatism is so slight you don’t need to correct it."
What is 20/20 vision?,"20/20 vision means you have normal visual acuity (or sharpness and clarity) at a distance of 20 feet away. It doesn’t mean perfect vision, though. It only means you can see clearly at a distance. Overall visual ability also measures: 20/15 vision is actually better than 20/20. Someone with 20/15 vision can see objects at 20 feet away that someone with 20/20 can only see at 15 feet away. The higher the second number, the less clear and sharp you’ll see objects at a distance. Someone with 20/200 has some vision, but doesn’t see with the same clarity as people......"
Will your vision get worse?,"Vision doesn’t worsen as a result of getting older, but your risk for eye-related conditions and diseases does get increase as you age. For example, you’re at a higher risk for the following after age 50: For better eye health, you can try the following in addition to eating ahealthy dietand exercising regularly:"
How often should you get your eyes checked?,"Your prescription can change, so it’s important to get regular eye exams. Adults ages 19 to 40 with vision problems should get their eyes checked at least every two years. Adults older than 40 should get them checked once a year. If you’re an adult with no vision problems, get your eyes checked every five years until age 30, and then at least every 2 to 4 years from age 40 to 65. After age 65, you’ll need regular eye exams at least every two years. Let your doctor know if you notice any changes to your vision and need......"
How Long Does It Take for the Effects from Eye Dilation Drops to Wear Off?,"Getting your eyes dilated is an important part of any complete eye exam. Once your doctor puts in the dilating drops, it takes about 20–30 minutes for your pupils to fully open, or dilate. After your eyes are fully dilated, the effects will last for four to six hours for most people. Some people feel the effects of dilating drops for longer, including people with lighter color eyes. Dilation in children can last up to a full day after the exam. It’s impossible for your doctor to tell you exactly how long the effects of dilation will last and how..."
What are the side effects of eye dilation drops?,"Dilation is harmless in the long term, but it does come with short-term side effects. These will usually last for about four to six hours. Side effects of dilation include: If you wear contact lenses, you may not be able to wear them until the dilation drops wear off."
Why is eye dilation important?,"Dilation allows an eye doctor to look inside your eyes. Dilating drops widen the pupil (the black part of your eye) so that it doesn’t get smaller when your doctor shines a light at it. The widened pupil allows your doctor to use a magnifying lens to look inside your eye and at the back of your eye. They’ll look at the retina, optic nerve, blood vessels, and other parts of your eye that can’t otherwise be seen. Dilation helps your eye doctor diagnose many eye conditions, including It also helps diagnose some chronic conditions that affect more than your..."
What’s the Difference Between PRK and LASIK?,"PRK vs. LASIK Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are both laser surgery techniques used to help improve eyesight. PRK has been around longer, but both are still widely used today. PRK and LASIK are both used to modify thecorneaof your eye. The cornea is made up of five thin, transparent layers of tissue over the front of your eye that bend (or refract) and focus light to help you see. PRK and LASIK each use different methods to help correct your vision by reshaping cornea tissue. With PRK, your eye surgeon takes away the top layer............"
What causes your eye to hurt when you blink?,"Common causes for eye pain when you blink include dry eyes, a stye, or pink eye (conjunctivitis). More serious conditions that can cause your eye to hurt when you blink include glaucoma or optic neuritis."
What is an ophthalmologist?,"Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with additional specialist training in the diagnosis and management of disorders of the eye and visual system. They are also sometimes called eye doctors or eye surgeons. In Australia, ophthalmologists need to complete at least 5 years of specialist training after they become a doctor. If you have an eye disease or visual disorder, your doctor or optometrist may refer you to an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologists do surgery and prescribe contact lenses and glasses as well as medicines for eye problems."

FIND A HEALTH SERVICE— TheService Findercan help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services."
Do I need a referral to see an ophthalmologist?,"It is important to get areferralfrom your doctor or optometrist to see an ophthalmologist. This is so that they can pass on useful important health information, and the ophthalmologist can later tell the doctor or optometrist about the results of your visit and any tests performed. If you don’t have a referral, neither Medicare nor private health insurance will contribute to the cost of your care. In an emergency, such as an eye injury or sudden loss of vision, go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital immediately, or call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance."
How much will an ophthalmologist cost?,"Thecostsof an ophthalmologist visit vary greatly, depending on the type of care you receive. Factors include whether it’s inhospital, whether you haveprivate health insurance, and what the ophthalmologistcharges."
"Optometrists, orthoptists and ophthalmologists: What’s the difference?","Optometrists are different from ophthalmologists. They can prescribe and fit glasses and contact lenses. They are also trained in screening for serious eye conditions such as glaucoma, but they are not doctors. Optometrists can give advice on visual problems and treat minor eye problems but will refer you to an ophthalmologist for the diagnosis and treatment of more serious eye conditions. Like optometrists, orthoptists are not doctors. They are allied healthcare professionals who specialise in assessing and managing eye movement disorders, such as double vision and squints (strabismus) in children and adults. Their role includes caring for people with eye......"
Why is cataract surgery performed?,"A cataract is an eye condition where the lens of your one or both of your eyes becomes cloudy. Cataractscan make your sight become blurry. If you have cataracts, you may also: Cataracts will not get better on their own. The treatment for cataracts is surgery on your affected eye."
Who does cataract surgery?,Cataract surgery is performed by anophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor). Your doctor or optometrist can help you tofind the right health professionalfor cataract treatment.
What happens during cataract surgery?,"On the day of the surgery, you will be given eye drops that include anantibiotic. You might be given an injection around your eye or eye drops to make the eye go numb. Most people have alocal anaesthetic and light sedation. During the procedure you will be asked to lie on your back. The doctor will make a small cut in your eye. This lets them remove your cloudy lens and insert the plastic lens. The operation usually takes less than 30 minutes. There will always be medical staff to talk to during the procedure. If you have any problems,......"
What are the risks of having cataract surgery?,"Problems with cataract surgery are uncommon. Some people have bleeding, an infection or damage to their eye. If you notice any of the following, contact your eye specialist or go to the emergency department:"
Are there alternatives to cataract surgery?,"During the early stages of cataracts, you may find that new glasses, improved lighting or other visual aids help. If your cataracts start to make everyday activities difficult, surgery is the best treatment."
What is short-sightedness?,"Short-sightedness (also known as myopia) is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred. Someone with myopia can achieve good vision with prescription glasses, contact lenses or laser surgery. Short-sightedness usually first appears in childhood."
How is short-sightedness caused?,"When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) and the lens. If you have normal vision, the light waves are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are short-sighted, the light waves from distant objects focus in front of, rather than on, the retina. Short-sightedness usually appears in the pre-teen years and often gets worse for a few years. It can also develop later — even in early adulthood. It is becoming more common. Myopia has been linked to......"
How is short-sightedness diagnosed?,An eye test using an eye chart will allow an optometrist or ophthalmologist to diagnose short-sightedness. Children should have their vision checked when they start both primary and secondary schools.
How is short-sightedness treated?,"Short-sightedness is usually corrected with prescription glasses. Contact lenses are also an option, but generally not for children.Laser refractive eye surgeryis now also common, but is only appropriate for adults. Some research suggests that certain treatments might be able to slow the progression of short-sightedness in children. If you want to know more about this, talk to your optometrist or doctor. Even if you have no concerns about your vision, it is a good idea to have your eyes checked every 2 years. Learn more here about thedevelopment and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

What is long-sightedness?,"Long-sightedness (also known as hyperopia) is a common eye condition that can be hard to detect. It makes close objects appear blurry, or you might be able to focus clearly but get tired eyes or headaches. For people with significant long-sightedness, vision can be blurry for things in the distance as well."
How is long-sightedness caused?,"The size and shape of the eye largely causes long-sightedness. When light entersthe eye, it is bent by the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye, and the lens. This process is known as refraction. If you have normal vision, the rays of light are brought into focus right on the retina, the layer at the back of the eye. If you are long-sighted, the cornea is not sufficiently curved or the eye is too short, so the light rays from close objects focus behind, rather than on, the retina when the eye is resting (not actively............"
How is long-sightedness diagnosed?,"Standard vision screening tests might not detect long-sightedness, but an optometrist or ophthalmologist can measure how well your eye focuses as part of an eye examination."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism is a commoneyecondition where the cornea or lens in your eye is not perfectly curved. Instead of being shaped like a soccer ball, it is curved like a rugby ball. This means that light entering the eye focuses at 2 places (rather than one) on the retina. This can make your vision mildly or severely blurry. Your ability to see both close up (long-sightedness) and far away (short-sightedness) are affected. There are 2 types of astigmatism:"
What are the symptoms of astigmatism?,Symptoms of astigmatism may include: CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS— Use theSymptom Checkerand find out if you need to seek medical help.

How is astigmatism diagnosed?,"Your optometrist orophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor)can diagnose astigmatism with an eye examination. Testing may include: If you have any concerns about your eyesight, see your optometrist or talk to your doctor."
How is astigmatism treated?,"Your healthcare professional can treat your astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses. Most people have mild astigmatism, and this treatment is enough. If you have severe astigmatism, you may need more extensive treatment with rigid contact lenses or laser eye surgery that can adjust your cornea’s shape."
What is strabismus?,Strabismus (or ‘squint’) is where one of your eyes points in towards your nose (convergent) or out towards your ear (divergent). Sometimes one eye may point up or down. Strabismus may be present all the time or only sometimes.
How does strabismus happen?,"Strabismus in adults can happen because of disease that affects your eye muscles (such as thyroid eye disease and myasthenia), disease that affects the nerves to your eye muscles (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) or trauma (where a physical force is applied directly to your eye). Strabismus can also be caused by trying to correct short- or long-sightedness, or by poor vision in one eye as a result of amblyopia (or ‘lazy eye’). Strabismus may not cause any symptoms. For some people it can be serious."
What is eye cancer?,Eye cancer develops when abnormal cells in your eye grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Many different cancers can affect theeyesor the muscles and tissue around the eye. Eye cancers are sometimes called 'intraocular cancers.'
What are the types of eye cancer?,"If the cancer starts to grow in the eye itself, it is called a primary cancer. If the cancer spreads to the eye (metastasises) from another body part, such as thebreastorlungsit is called a secondary cancer. There are a few different types of primary eye cancer."
What are the symptoms of eye cancer?,"Many people with eye cancer do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may find the condition when you have a routineeye test.If you do have symptoms, you may notice: All of these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. But if you are worried, talk to your doctor."
What causes eye cancer?,"Doctors don't fully understand why eye cancer develops, but there are some factors that increase your risk of eye melanoma, including: UV radiation from sunlight (or sunlamps) may also increase your risk for melanoma of the eye."
How is eye cancer diagnosed?,"If your doctor thinks you might have eye cancer, they will examine the outside of your eye and use special instruments to look inside it. If you need further tests, your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist called anophthalmologist. The specialist may check your eye using a special microscope, or take photographs of the back of your eye with a special camera. They may also refer you for other tests, including anultrasound. Sometimes, you may have abiopsy, where a small sample of tissue is removed to be checked in a laboratory. You might also have tests such as..."
How is eye cancer treated?,"The type of treatment will depend on the type of eye cancer and how far it has spread (known as itsstage). Usually, you will need surgery to remove the tumour, part of the eye or sometimes the whole eye. After the surgery, you can have an artificial eye implanted, that looks like a real eye. Other treatments may include laser therapy to destroy cancer cells. If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body, your health team may also offer you radiation therapy or other medicines."
What is glaucoma?,"Glaucoma is a common eye problem that causes vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve. If untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness. Usually the deterioration in vision is very gradual and not noticeable, so regulareye examinationsare recommended for people from middle age. Once detected, glaucoma can be treated to prevent or delay further vision damage."
What are the types of glaucoma?,There are several different types of glaucoma. The 2 main types of glaucoma are: Different types of open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma can be categorised as either: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma in Australia.
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"Most people with glaucoma have few or no symptoms until their eyesight is damaged. If you haveprimary open angle glaucomayou may have no symptoms, or you may lose peripheral vision at first. You might not notice this until there is significant optic nerve damage. If you havechronic angle-closure glaucomayou sometimes get vision problems, such as a halo-like image around lights or you may have no symptoms. If you haveacute angle-closure glaucomayou may get sudden, severe eye pain with nausea and vomiting, headache, watery eyes,blurred vision, and halos around bright lights. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency, and you should seek......"
What causes glaucoma?,"Doctors don’t clearly understand why glaucoma happens. Glaucoma refers to a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve that links theeyeto the brain. The optic nerve carries signals from the back of your eye to the brain and allows you to see. Nerve damage can result from problems with the fluid in the eye. Sometimes, the pressure of the fluid inside the eye rises, and the fluid presses hard on the optic nerve, damaging it. Glaucoma can sometimes occur even when the fluid pressure in the eye is normal."
Who is at risk of glaucoma?,You are at higher risk of developing glaucoma if you:
How is glaucoma diagnosed?,"An optometrist orophthalmologist(specialist eye doctor) can detect it early on if you have regulareye examinationsevery 1 to 2 years.

How is glaucoma treated?,"If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you need prompt treatment to reduce the pressure. This may be done with eye drops or an intravenous medicine. You may also need surgery. Nerve cells damaged by glaucoma can’t be repaired. Treatment is designed to prevent or slow further damage, mainly by reducing the pressure in the eye. This may involve: Glaucoma surgeryis usually an outpatient or day-surgery procedure. You might have alocal anaesthetic(such as eye drops) or ageneral anaesthetic. Your surgeon will explain to you the preferred type of surgery and anaesthetic for your condition."
Can glaucoma be prevented?,"Unfortunately, while it can be managed, glaucoma can’t be prevented."
What is uveitis?,"Uveitis is inflammation that occurs in the eye. Inflammation is normally one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as uveitis, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Uveitis is the most common eye problem associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Uveitis is more common in children who have a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)."
What are the symptoms of uveitis?,"There are different kinds of uveitis associated with JIA. The most common form of uveitis has no symptoms (‘silent uveitis’), which is why regular eye check ups are essential. However your child may complain of blurring of vision, sensitivity to light, and, rarely, eye redness or pain. If left untreated, uveitis can result in loss of vision."
What causes uveitis in JIA?,"The immune system, which usually fights infections, attacks the inner part of the eye. No one knows why this occurs in JIA patients."
How is uveitis diagnosed?,"As there may be no symptoms, all children with JIA need to be regularly assessed by an ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor). The ophthalmologist will look into the back of your child’s eyes with a special microscope called a slit lamp. Some children may be assessed by an optometrist, particularly older children (e.g. over 8 years of age). How often each child needs to be seen will be decided by their ophthalmologist or optometrist. For children without uveitis they may be seen initially every three months then over time this may extend to less often (e.g. six monthly). Children with active..."
How is uveitis treated?,"If uveitis occurs, the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist will work together to treat your child to prevent permanent eye damage. Treatment may require steroid eye drops. Sometimes other eye drops are required. If the eye drops don’t control the uveitis or the uveitis is severe, your child may require other medicines by mouth or injection. These medicines aim to suppress their immune system and may include methotrexate and TNF blockers. Some children who develop complications of severe uveitis may require eye surgery to improve their vision and protect their eyes."
What is retinal detachment?,"Retinal detachment occurs when the retina, the light-sensitive nerve tissue lining the inside of the eye, becomes separated from where it is normally attached at the back of the eye. When this happens, the retina stops functioning, causing loss of vision. The retina is responsible for converting light into nerve impulses that are then sent along the optic nerve to the brain.
